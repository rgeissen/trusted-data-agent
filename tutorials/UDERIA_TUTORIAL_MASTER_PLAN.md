## 🎭 Profile Personas Used Throughout Tutorials

A core differentiator of Uderia is the ability to **orchestrate a team of specialized AI personas** through profile switching. Throughout these tutorials, we demonstrate six key profiles that represent different user roles and use cases. Think of profiles not as configuration files, but as complete expert personas—each with their own LLM, tools, knowledge, and learned patterns.

**The Profile Lineup:**

1. **@ANALYST** - Business Intelligence Persona
   - **Role:** Business Analyst, Product Manager
   - **LLM:** Gemini 1.5 Flash (fast, cost-effective)
   - **Specialty:** Business insights, visualizations, executive reporting
   - **Knowledge:** Business metrics, KPIs, fitness_db business context
   - **Appears in:** Modules 1.3, 2.2, 4.1, 6.2, 10.1

2. **@DBA** - Database Administrator Persona
   - **Role:** Database Admin, Data Engineer
   - **LLM:** Claude Sonnet 3.5 (reliable SQL optimization)
   - **Specialty:** Query optimization, schema analysis, performance tuning
   - **Knowledge:** SQL best practices, Teradata optimization, schema docs
   - **Appears in:** Modules 2.2, 3.2, 4.1, 8.2, 10.2

3. **@QUALITY** - Data Quality Engineer Persona
   - **Role:** Data Steward, Quality Analyst
   - **LLM:** Claude Sonnet 3.5 (thorough validation)
   - **Specialty:** Data validation, anomaly detection, compliance audits
   - **Knowledge:** Quality standards, constraints, validation rules
   - **Appears in:** Modules 2.2, 3.1, 10.3

4. **@LOCAL** - Privacy-First Persona
   - **Role:** Compliance Officer, Privacy-Conscious User
   - **LLM:** Ollama Llama 3.1 70B (on-premises, zero cloud)
   - **Specialty:** Sovereign data analysis with complete privacy
   - **Knowledge:** Same as @ANALYST but locally stored/executed
   - **Appears in:** Modules 2.2, 5.2, 5.3, 10.4

5. **@PROD** - Production Workhorse Persona
   - **Role:** Default automation profile for APIs and scheduled jobs
   - **LLM:** Claude Sonnet 3.5 (balanced reliability)

   - **Knowledge:** Cross-domain general purpose
   - **Appears in:** Modules 2.1, 2.3, 2.4, 9.1, 10.5

6. **@COST** - Budget-Conscious Persona
   - **Role:** Cost optimization, high-volume queries
   - **LLM:** Gemini 1.5 Flash (cheapest option)
   - **Specialty:** Simple lookups, batch jobs, development/testing
   - **Knowledge:** Minimal (reduces overhead)
   - **Appears in:** Modules 4.4, 7.2, 10.5 (optional)

**The "God Mode" Concept:**

Rather than being limited to one agent's perspective, Uderia users can **orchestrate an entire team of expert personas**, switching between them as naturally as consulting different colleagues. This allows one person to perform work that traditionally requires multiple specialists:

- Need SQL optimization? → Switch to **@DBA**
- Need business insights? → Switch to **@ANALYST**
- Need data validation? → Switch to **@QUALITY**
- Need privacy compliance? → Switch to **@LOCAL**
- Need to operationalize? → Switch to **@PROD**

Each profile has its own knowledge collections and learned execution patterns (planner repositories), making profile switching equivalent to accessing specialized domain expertise instantly.

**Note:** Detailed specifications for each profile are provided in the "Profile Ecosystem Reference" section before Module 10. They are introduced narratively in Module 2.2 and demonstrated throughout subsequent modules.

### 1.1 Welcome to Uderia - The Platform Promise
**Duration:** 2-3 minutes  
**Learning Objectives:**
- Understand Uderia's unique positioning in the AI landscape
- Recognize the six core principles
- See the fundamental "before vs after" transformation

**Key Topics to Cover:**
- [ ] The problem: Traditional AI tools force trade-offs (cloud intelligence vs data privacy)
- [ ] The Uderia solution: Best of both worlds
- [ ] Six core principles overview (visual diagram)
- [ ] Platform overview screenshot tour

**Narration Script:**
```
Welcome to Uderia—the platform that finally ends the impossible choice between 
cloud intelligence and data privacy.

For too long, organizations have been forced into a corner: either send your 
sensitive data to powerful cloud models and sacrifice sovereignty, or run local 
models and compromise on capability. It's been one or the other—never both.

Uderia shatters this false dichotomy.

Imagine having the reasoning power of Claude, GPT-4, or Gemini—while keeping your 
most sensitive data completely private on your own infrastructure. That's Uderia's 
hybrid intelligence architecture: cloud-level planning meets local execution.

But we go far beyond just hybrid deployment. Uderia is built on six revolutionary 
principles that transform how you work with enterprise data:

First—ACTIONABLE: Your conversational discovery IS your production-ready API. No 
handoffs. No rebuilding. From insight to automation in seconds, not weeks.

Second—TRANSPARENT: No more AI black boxes. Watch the agent plan, execute, and 
self-correct in real-time. Every decision, every tool call, fully visible.

Third—EFFICIENT: Our Fusion Optimizer uses strategic planning, RAG-powered 
self-learning, and proactive optimization to slash costs from dollars to cents.

Fourth—SOVEREIGNTY: Your data, your rules, your environment. Whether you choose 
cloud hyperscalers, AWS Bedrock, or fully private Ollama models—you're in control.

Fifth—FINANCIAL GOVERNANCE: Track every token, every penny, in real-time. Complete 
visibility into LLM spending with comprehensive analytics and cost optimization.

And sixth—COLLABORATIVE: Transform individual expertise into collective intelligence 
through our Intelligence Marketplace. Share patterns, subscribe to community wisdom, 
and amplify capabilities together.

This isn't just another data chat tool. Uderia is a complete AI orchestration platform 
that delivers enterprise results with optimized speed and minimal token cost.

Over the next few tutorials, you'll see exactly how Uderia transforms every aspect 
of data operations—from your first conversation to production deployment at scale.

Let's dive in.

### 1.3 Your First Conversation - From Question to Insight
**Duration:** 3-4 minutes  
**Learning Objectives:**
- Execute a simple query successfully
- Understand query → insight → action flow
- See immediate value in action

**Key Topics to Cover:**
- [ ] Typing a natural language query
- [ ] Watching the Live Status Panel (strategic plan appears)
- [ ] Tool execution visualization
- [ ] Receiving structured results
- [ ] Understanding the response format

**Narration Script:**
```
Let's ask your first question. No SQL. No technical syntax. Just ask naturally, like 
you would a colleague.

We're working with a fitness equipment retail database. Type: *"What are the top 5 
products by revenue this month?"*

Hit enter. Watch what happens.

**LIVE STATUS PANEL ACTIVATES:**

Strategic Plan appears instantly. The agent isn't blindly executing—it's thinking:

```
Phase 1: Identify relevant tables (Sales, Products, SaleDetails)
Phase 2: Calculate revenue by product for current month
Phase 3: Sort descending, return top 5
```

This is Uderia's transparency. No loading spinner. No wondering. You're watching a 
strategic blueprint unfold in real-time.

**TACTICAL EXECUTION:**

The agent selects its tool: `base_readQuery` (SQL execution)

Watch the SQL generate:

```sql
SELECT p.ProductName, p.Brand, 
       SUM(sd.Quantity * sd.UnitPrice) as Revenue
FROM Products p
JOIN SaleDetails sd ON p.ProductID = sd.ProductID
JOIN Sales s ON sd.SaleID = s.SaleID
WHERE EXTRACT(MONTH FROM s.SaleDate) = CURRENT_MONTH
GROUP BY p.ProductName, p.Brand
ORDER BY Revenue DESC
LIMIT 5;
```

Every parameter visible. Zero guesswork.

**RAW DATA RETURNS:**

Click into Live Status. Inspect the exact JSON response. Complete visibility.

**INTELLIGENT RENDERING:**

The agent doesn't dump data. It formats results beautifully:

```
1. Treadmill Pro 3000 (FitTech) - $45,230
2. Elliptical Elite (CardioMax) - $38,900
3. Weight Bench Deluxe (IronGrip) - $32,150
4. Rowing Machine Pro (AquaFit) - $28,500
5. Spin Bike Ultra (CycleMax) - $24,100
```

Clean. Formatted. Actionable.

**FOLLOW-UP:**

Type: *"Show me customer demographics for buyers of that top treadmill."*

Notice what just happened. The agent remembers "that top treadmill" = Treadmill Pro 3000. 
It knows the table structure. Context retained.

New strategic plan:

```
Phase 1: Find customers who purchased ProductID 1047 (Treadmill Pro 3000)
Phase 2: Retrieve demographics from Customers table
Phase 3: Aggregate by location, age, visualize
```

Joining Sales → Customers automatically. You didn't specify a single table name.

**THE POWER:**

Question → Insight: Seconds.
Insight → Follow-up: Seamless.
Context: Retained.

No Python notebooks. No SQL editors. No context switching.

Just you, your questions, and an agent that shows its work.

**THE KICKER:**

Every query you just ran? Already available via REST API. Your conversational discovery 
is already operationalized. We'll explore this in Module 2.

**ONE MORE THING:**

See that profile indicator (top right)? You're using @ANALYST right now—business 
analyst profile.

But imagine switching to:
- **@DBA** - SQL optimization expert
- **@QUALITY** - Data validation specialist  
- **@LOCAL** - Privacy-first, zero cloud exposure

One person orchestrating multiple expert personas. Switch like consulting different 
colleagues.

This is "god mode." We'll explore it in depth soon.

**WELCOME TO UDERIA:**

Intelligence that's actionable, transparent, and built for speed.

You're not just chatting with AI. You're orchestrating specialized expertise.

Let's keep going.

## Module 2: ACTIONABLE - From Discovery to Production
**Goal:** Demonstrate seamless operationalization from conversation to automation

### 2.1 The Two-in-One Philosophy: Conversation → API
**Duration:** 3-4 minutes  
**Learning Objectives:**
- Understand the unique "discovery is production" paradigm
- See how a conversational query becomes an API call
- Grasp the value of eliminating handoffs

**Key Topics to Cover:**
- [ ] Traditional workflow: Analyst → Data Engineer → API Developer (days/weeks)
- [ ] Uderia workflow: One conversation → Immediate API (seconds)
- [ ] REST API endpoint overview
- [ ] Session management concept
- [ ] Bearer token authentication basics

**Narration Script:**
```
Let's talk about what separates Uderia from every other data tool.

**THE OLD WORLD:**

Traditional workflow for ONE analytics question:

```
Business Analyst asks: "What are our top revenue products?"
  ↓ (2 days)
Data Analyst writes SQL in notebook
  ↓ (3 days)  
Data Engineer rebuilds it in pipeline
  ↓ (5 days)
API Developer wraps endpoint
  ↓ (2 days)
DevOps deploys to production

Total: ~2 weeks, 4 handoffs, context loss
```

This friction kills innovation.

**THE UDERIA WAY:**

We just asked: *"What are the top 5 products by revenue this month?"*

Got answer in seconds. That was conversational discovery.

**Here's the revolution:**

That EXACT query is already available via REST API.

- No rebuilding
- No translation
- No handoffs
- No deployment

**WATCH:**

Postman → `/v1/query/submit` endpoint

```json
POST https://tda.uderia.com/api/v1/query/submit
Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN

{
  "query": "What are the top 5 products by revenue this month?",
  "session_id": "your-session-id"
}
```

Same question. Same strategic plan. Same tool execution. Same results.

**Or cURL:**

```bash
curl -X POST https://tda.uderia.com/api/v1/query/submit \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"query": "What are the top 5 products by revenue this month?", "session_id": "abc123"}'
```

**THE PARADIGM:**

Discovery = Production.

Conversation = Automation.

No engineering team. No deployment cycle. Zero friction.

**THE MULTIPLIER:**

Now imagine:

1. @DBA profile → Query optimization
2. @ANALYST profile → Business visualization  
3. @QUALITY profile → Data validation

All three conversations → All three APIs → Instantly.

You're not automating one query. You're operationalizing an entire team of expert personas.

**THE IMPACT:**

Old world:
- Weeks to production
- Multiple specialists required
- Context lost in handoffs

Uderia:
- Seconds to production
- One person orchestrating profiles
- Context preserved

**From insight to automation: One conversation.**

This is actionable intelligence.

Let's see how it works.
```

**Screen Capture Plan:**
- [ ] Traditional workflow diagram: Analyst → Engineer → API Dev → DevOps (days/weeks)
- [ ] Uderia workflow: One conversation → Immediate API (seconds)
- [ ] Live query execution showing `base_readQuery` tool call
- [ ] Switch to Postman: same query via `/v1/query/submit` endpoint
- [ ] Show cURL command with actual request/response
- [ ] Side-by-side comparison: UI results vs API results (identical)
- [ ] REST API documentation page

**Supporting Materials:**
- REST API documentation (query endpoints)
- Postman collection with pre-configured requests
- cURL command examples
- Workflow comparison diagram
- MCP tools reference (base_readQuery)

### 2.2 Profile System: Complete AI Personas
**Duration:** 5-7 minutes  
**Learning Objectives:**
- Understand profiles as complete AI personas (LLM + Tools + Knowledge + Patterns)
- See how RAG Knowledge Collections integrate into profiles
- Learn how Planner Repositories provide learned execution patterns
- Master profile switching as persona switching
- Recognize the power of bundled intelligence

**Key Topics to Cover:**
- [ ] What is a profile? (Four-component persona architecture)
- [ ] Component 1: LLM Provider configuration
- [ ] Component 2: MCP Tools/Prompts (capabilities)
- [ ] Component 3: RAG Knowledge Collections (domain expertise)
- [ ] Component 4: Planner Repositories (execution patterns)
- [ ] Profile tags and switching (@DBA, @ANALYST, @LOCAL)
- [ ] Creating profiles as specialized personas
- [ ] Marketplace integration (subscribing to shared knowledge/planners)

**Narration Script:**
```
Now let's talk about profiles—but not as simple configuration files. Profiles are 
something far more powerful: they're complete AI personas with memory, tools, knowledge, 
and learned behaviors.

When you switch profiles in Uderia, you're not just changing which LLM you're using. 
You're switching to a completely different intelligent agent with its own expertise, 
capabilities, and experience.

Let me show you what I mean.

**THE FOUR PILLARS OF A PROFILE:**

A profile bundles four critical components into a cohesive persona:

**1. LLM Provider** - Which language model powers the reasoning
Think: Claude Opus for complex analysis, Gemini Flash for cost efficiency, Ollama 
for complete privacy.

**2. MCP Tools & Prompts** - Which capabilities are available
Think: Database tools (base_readQuery, base_tableList), Quality tools (qlty_validateData), 
Admin tools (dba_databaseVersion), Platform tools (TDA_FinalReport, TDA_Charting).

**3. RAG Knowledge Collections** - What domain expertise the agent has access to
Think: SQL optimization guides, database documentation, data quality standards, business 
logic rules, company-specific knowledge.

**4. Planner Repositories** - Which execution patterns the agent has mastered
Think: Champion cases from successful queries—proven strategies for revenue analysis, 
customer segmentation, performance optimization, all learned from past successes.

Together, these four components create a complete persona. Let me show you with a 
real example.

**PERSONA EXAMPLE: @DBA Profile**

Navigate to Setup → Profiles. Let's look at the "Database Administrator" profile with 
tag @DBA.

**Component 1: LLM Provider**
- Model: Claude Sonnet 3.5 (reliable, balanced performance)
- Cost tier: Mid-range (~$3 per 1M input tokens)

**Component 2: MCP Tools**
- Teradata MCP Server enabled
- Tools available:
  - base_databaseList (list all databases)
  - base_tableList (list tables in a database)
  - base_tableDDL (get table structure)
  - base_readQuery (execute SQL)
  - dba_databaseVersion (system version info)
  - qlty_profileColumn (data profiling)
  - qlty_validateData (quality checks)

**Component 3: RAG Knowledge Collections**
Let's click into the "Knowledge" tab for this profile.

You see three collections attached:
1. "Teradata SQL Optimization Guide" (23 documents)
   - Contains best practices for query performance
   - Index usage strategies
   - Join optimization techniques
   
2. "fitness_db Schema Documentation" (5 documents)
   - Table relationships
   - Business logic rules
   - Data quality constraints
   
3. "Database Administration Runbooks" (12 documents)
   - Troubleshooting procedures
   - Maintenance scripts
   - Performance tuning guides

When you ask this profile a question, it doesn't just have access to database tools—
it has access to your organization's accumulated DBA knowledge. 

Ask: "What's the best way to optimize a query joining Sales and SaleDetails for large 
date ranges?"

The agent retrieves relevant content from your SQL Optimization Guide: "For large 
date ranges, use partition elimination with explicit date predicates. Consider 
creating a covering index on SaleDate + frequently joined columns."

This isn't generic LLM knowledge. This is YOUR organization's expertise, embedded 
into the profile.

**Component 4: Planner Repositories**
Now click the "Planners" tab.

You see the "DBA_Champion_Cases" repository with 47 successful execution patterns:
- "Monthly Sales Aggregation" (champion case, 94/100 efficiency)
- "Customer Purchase History Lookup" (champion case, 91/100 efficiency)
- "Product Revenue Analysis with Trends" (champion case, 96/100 efficiency)

Each case contains:
- The original query that succeeded
- The strategic plan that was used
- The exact tool execution sequence (e.g., base_readQuery with optimized SQL)
- Token usage and cost data
- Efficiency metrics

When you ask the @DBA profile a new question, it searches these repositories for 
similar past successes. If it finds one, it uses that proven pattern as a few-shot 
example to guide the new execution.

Ask: "Show me top revenue products by category this quarter."

The Live Status Panel shows:
```
🔍 RAG-RETRIEVED CONTEXT:

Similar patterns found in DBA_Champion_Cases:
1. "Product Revenue Analysis with Trends" (similarity: 0.92)
   - Strategy: Single aggregation with RANK() window function
   - Tools: base_readQuery → TDA_FinalReport
   - SQL pattern: SUM(Quantity * UnitPrice) GROUP BY with PARTITION BY
   - Efficiency: 96/100 (champion case)
```

The agent learned from past success. It's using the proven champion pattern, not 
reinventing the approach.

This is profile-bound learning. The @DBA persona gets smarter every time a DBA uses it.

**PERSONA COMPARISON: @ANALYST Profile**

Now switch to the "Business Analyst" profile (@ANALYST). Watch what changes.

**LLM Provider:** Gemini 1.5 Flash (fast, cheap—$0.075 per 1M input tokens)

**MCP Tools:** Same Teradata tools, but ALSO:
- TDA_Charting (visualization generation)
- TDA_LLMTask (natural language analysis)

**RAG Knowledge:** Completely different collections:
1. "Business Metrics Definitions" (15 documents)
   - KPI calculation formulas
   - Reporting standards
   - Business terminology
   
2. "fitness_db Business Context" (8 documents)
   - Product categories explained
   - Customer segmentation rules
   - Sales cycle patterns

**Planner Repositories:** Different patterns:
- "Monthly_Executive_Reports" (23 cases focused on summarization)
- "Customer_Segmentation_Analysis" (17 cases with visualization)
- "Trend_Analysis_Patterns" (31 cases with time-series queries)

Same platform. Same database. Completely different persona.

Ask the @ANALYST profile: "Show me top revenue products by category this quarter."

The strategic plan is different:
- Phase 1: Query data with business-friendly column aliases
- Phase 2: Calculate percentage contribution by category
- Phase 3: Generate bar chart visualization
- Phase 4: Summarize insights in executive language

It uses TDA_Charting to create a visual. It frames results in business terms, not 
technical output. Because this persona has different knowledge, different patterns, 
and different priorities.

**PROFILE SWITCHING = PERSONA SWITCHING:**

This is the profound insight: switching profiles isn't about changing infrastructure. 
It's about switching intelligent personas.

Need database optimization? Switch to @DBA.
- Tools: Database admin tools
- Knowledge: SQL optimization, schema docs
- Patterns: Performance-tuned queries
- Behavior: Technical, optimization-focused

Need business insights? Switch to @ANALYST.
- Tools: Charting, summarization
- Knowledge: Business metrics, KPI definitions
- Patterns: Visualization-heavy reports
- Behavior: Executive-friendly, insight-focused

Need complete privacy? Switch to @LOCAL.
- LLM: Ollama (on-premises, zero cloud)
- Tools: Same capabilities, local execution
- Knowledge: Same collections, private retrieval
- Patterns: Same strategies, sovereign infrastructure

One platform. Multiple specialized personas. Each with their own expertise.

**CREATING A NEW PERSONA:**

Let's create a custom profile from scratch.

Setup → Profiles → New Profile

Name: "Data Quality Auditor"
Tag: @QUALITY

**Step 1: Choose LLM**
Provider: Claude Sonnet 3.5 (reliable for analysis)

**Step 2: Select MCP Server**
Teradata MCP → This gives us database access

**Step 3: Attach Knowledge Collections**
Click "Add Knowledge Collection"
- Select: "Data Quality Standards" (your org's validation rules)
- Select: "fitness_db Constraints Documentation" (expected value ranges)

**Step 4: Attach Planner Repositories**
Click "Add Planner Repository"
- Select: "Quality_Validation_Patterns" (champion cases for data validation queries)

**Step 5: Configure Tool Preferences**
Enable specific tools:
- qlty_profileColumn (profiling)
- qlty_validateData (validation)
- base_readQuery (data sampling)

Save profile.

Now @QUALITY is a complete persona: 
- Reasoning: Claude Sonnet
- Capabilities: Quality tools + database access
- Expertise: Your org's quality standards
- Experience: Proven validation patterns

Ask @QUALITY: "Validate the Customers table for data quality issues."

The agent:
1. Retrieves validation rules from your "Data Quality Standards" collection
2. Uses proven patterns from "Quality_Validation_Patterns" repository
3. Executes qlty_profileColumn and qlty_validateData tools
4. Reports findings against YOUR organization's standards

This isn't generic data profiling. This is a specialized quality auditor persona with 
your company's rules and proven validation workflows.

**MARKETPLACE INTEGRATION:**

Here's where it gets powerful for organizations.

Go to Marketplace → Knowledge Repositories.

Browse community-shared collections:
- "Teradata SQL Best Practices" (4,200 subscribers)
- "Retail Analytics Patterns" (1,800 subscribers)
- "Customer Churn Analysis Techniques" (950 subscribers)

Find one relevant: "Retail Analytics Patterns" 

Click "Subscribe" → Select your @ANALYST profile → Confirm.

That collection is now attached to your @ANALYST persona. Instant expertise expansion.

Or browse Marketplace → Planner Repositories:
- "E-commerce Revenue Optimization" (3,100 subscribers, 127 champion cases)
- "Customer Lifetime Value Analysis" (2,400 subscribers, 89 cases)

Subscribe "E-commerce Revenue Optimization" to your @ANALYST profile.

Now your @ANALYST persona has 127 additional proven patterns from the community's 
best executions.

Your profiles don't just grow from your own usage—they grow from collective intelligence.

**ORCHESTRATING A TEAM OF EXPERTS:**

Here's the ultimate power move. You're not working with ONE agent. You're orchestrating 
a TEAM of specialized experts—and you can switch between them instantly.

Watch this workflow:

**Scenario: Complex Business Intelligence Project**

You need to analyze Q4 revenue performance, but the workflow requires multiple types 
of expertise. In a traditional organization, this would involve:
- Database Admin to optimize queries
- Data Quality Engineer to validate data
- Business Analyst to generate insights
- Executive to review and approve

That's four people. Four handoffs. Days of coordination.

With Uderia? You ARE all four experts. Watch.

**Step 1: Start with @DBA - Database Optimization**

Type: "@DBA What's the most efficient way to query Q4 revenue across all product 
categories?"

The @DBA persona:
- Uses SQL optimization knowledge from your Teradata guides
- Applies proven champion patterns for revenue aggregation
- Generates optimal SQL with proper indexing strategy
- Returns: Optimized query structure

Result: "Use partitioned query with covering index on SaleDate, ProductType. Estimated 
execution time: 1.2s for 2.3M rows."

**Step 2: Switch to @QUALITY - Data Validation**

Type: "@QUALITY Validate the data quality for Q4 sales data before analysis."

The @QUALITY persona:
- Uses your organization's data quality standards
- Executes qlty_profileColumn on Sales table
- Applies validation rules from your quality knowledge base
- Returns: Data quality report

Result: "Q4 data validated: 99.7% completeness, 2 outliers flagged in SaleDetails 
(likely data entry errors), recommend excluding SaleID 45023, 45089."

**Step 3: Switch to @ANALYST - Business Intelligence**

Type: "@ANALYST Generate Q4 revenue analysis by category with trends and visualizations."

The @ANALYST persona:
- Uses business metrics definitions for proper KPI calculation
- Applies executive reporting patterns from champion cases
- Generates TDA_Charting visualizations
- Frames insights in business language

Result: Beautiful charts + "Cardio equipment down 18% YoY due to market saturation. 
Accessories up 34% driven by home fitness trend. Recommend diversification strategy."

**Step 4: Switch to @LOCAL - Sensitive Deep Dive**

Type: "@LOCAL Show me individual customer purchase patterns for our top 10 customers."

The @LOCAL persona:
- Uses Ollama (local model, zero cloud exposure)
- Same MCP tools, but execution stays on-premises
- Customer PII never leaves your infrastructure
- Returns: Detailed customer analysis with complete privacy

Result: Customer-level insights without compromising sovereignty.

**Four personas. Four specializations. One seamless workflow. Under 5 minutes.**

This is what we call "God Mode"—you're not limited to one agent's perspective. You 
orchestrate an entire team of specialized experts, each with their own knowledge base 
and proven execution patterns, switching between them as naturally as asking a colleague 
for their input.

No coordination overhead. No context lost in handoffs. No delays.

Just instant access to specialized intelligence, perfectly suited for each phase of work.

**THE PROFILE PARADIGM SHIFT:**

Forget "configuration management." Profiles are intelligent personas:

- @DBA knows SQL optimization and has proven DBA workflows
- @ANALYST speaks business language and has visualization patterns  
- @QUALITY enforces your org's standards and has validation playbooks
- @LOCAL preserves sovereignty while maintaining same capabilities

Switch profiles. Switch personas. Orchestrate experts. Work in god mode.

And every profile gets smarter:
- RAG captures successful queries as champion cases
- Knowledge collections grow with new documentation
- Marketplace subscriptions add community wisdom
- Planner repositories expand with every execution

This is profile-bound continuous improvement. Your personas evolve.

**COLLABORATIVE INTELLIGENCE AT SCALE:**

In traditional organizations, expertise is siloed:
- The DBA knows database optimization but not business context
- The analyst knows metrics but not data quality rules
- The quality engineer knows validation but not SQL tuning

In Uderia, YOU have access to ALL specialized personas, each with complete domain 
expertise, and you can orchestrate them together in a single workflow.

This isn't just faster. This is a fundamentally different way of working.

One person. Multiple expert personas. Instant switching. Zero friction.

From individual contributor to orchestrator of specialized intelligence.

From "I need to ask the DBA" to "Let me switch to @DBA persona."

From days of coordination to seconds of profile switching.

This is Uderia's profile system. Not just settings—complete AI personas with memory, 
tools, knowledge, and experience.

Infrastructure as personas. Intelligence as a package. Expertise as a profile.

And YOU as the orchestrator. God mode activated.

### 2.3 REST API Power: Operationalize Everything
**Duration:** 4-5 minutes  
**Learning Objectives:**
- Master REST API capabilities
- Understand async task pattern
- Learn endpoint categories

**Key Topics to Cover:**
- [ ] API endpoint categories (session, query, task, config, RAG, analytics)
- [ ] Async submit + poll pattern
- [ ] Session management (create, reuse, delete)
- [ ] Long-lived access tokens
- [ ] Profile override via API

**Narration Script:**
```
Now let's see the REST API that makes everything programmable.

**SIX ENDPOINT CATEGORIES:**

1. **Session Management** - Create/delete conversation contexts
2. **Query Execution** - Submit/poll/retrieve  
3. **Task Management** - Cancel, check status
4. **Configuration** - Switch profiles, control MCP
5. **RAG Operations** - Manage knowledge collections
6. **Analytics** - Track costs, tokens, efficiency

**AUTHENTICATION:**

Admin Panel → Generate long-lived access token (90 days or permanent).

Copy once. Never shown again. Store securely.

**WORKFLOW:**

**Step 1: Create Session**

```bash
POST /api/v1/sessions/create
{
  "session_name": "Revenue Analysis",
  "profile_override": "@PROD"
}

→ {"session_id": "abc-123"}
```

Isolated conversation context. All queries share memory.

**Step 2: Submit Query (Async)**

```bash
POST /api/v1/query/submit
{
  "query": "What are top 5 products by revenue this month?",
  "session_id": "abc-123"
}

→ {"task_id": "task_789"}
```

No immediate results. Agent works in background.

**Step 3: Poll Status**

```bash
GET /api/v1/query/status/task_789

→ {"status": "running", "progress": "Phase 1: Database query"}

(poll again)

→ {"status": "completed", "result_ready": true}
```

**Step 4: Retrieve Results**

```bash
GET /api/v1/query/result/task_789

→ {
  "query": "...",
  "answer": "...",
  "tool_calls": [
    {"tool": "base_readQuery", "args": {...}, "result": [...]}
  ],
  "tokens": {"input": 1250, "output": 320},
  "cost": 0.0042
}
```

Everything you'd see in UI—as JSON.

Answer + Tool executions + Token counts + Costs.

Complete transparency via API.

**Step 5: Follow-Up (Context Preserved)**

```bash
POST /api/v1/query/submit
{
  "query": "Show customer demographics for that top product",
  "session_id": "abc-123"
}
```

Agent remembers previous query. Context maintained across API calls.

**PROFILE OVERRIDE:**

```bash
POST /api/v1/query/submit
{
  "query": "Complex analytical question",
  "session_id": "abc-123",
  "profile_override": "@OPUS"
}
```

This query runs on Claude Opus. Next query returns to default profile.

**TASK CANCELLATION:**

```bash
POST /api/v1/tasks/cancel/task_789
```

Gracefully stops long-running execution.

**PRODUCTION USE CASES:**

- Batch processing (Airflow)
- Chatbot integrations (Flowise)
- Custom dashboards (live insights)
- CI/CD validation queries
- Scheduled overnight reports

Your conversational intelligence—fully programmable.

Production-grade AI orchestration.
```

**Screen Capture Plan:**
- [ ] API documentation landing page with six categories
- [ ] Admin panel: Generate long-lived access token
- [ ] Postman collection: Session creation request/response
- [ ] Postman: Query submission (async) → task_id returned

---

### 2.4 Airflow Integration: Production Automation
**Duration:** 3-4 minutes  
**Learning Objectives:**
- Understand batch automation use case
- Learn DAG structure for Uderia integration
- See production-ready patterns

**Key Topics to Cover:**
- [ ] Apache Airflow integration overview
- [ ] Example DAG walkthrough
- [ ] Session reuse pattern
- [ ] Profile override for specialized workloads
- [ ] Async polling pattern for long-running queries

**Narration Script:**
```
Let's put the REST API into production with Apache Airflow—industry-standard workflow orchestration.

Uderia ships with production-ready DAG examples. Deploy immediately.

**AIRFLOW UI:** "TDA Execute Questions" DAG - Runs analytical queries daily at 6 AM.

**CODE STRUCTURE:** `tda_00_execute_questions.py`

**1. SESSION REUSE PATTERN**

Create ONE session for all queries:

```python
def create_tda_session(**context):
    response = requests.post(
        f"{TDA_BASE_URL}/api/v1/sessions/create",
        headers={"Authorization": f"Bearer {TDA_ACCESS_TOKEN}"},
        json={"session_name": f"Airflow Batch {context['ds']}"}
    )
    session_id = response.json()["session_id"]
    context['ti'].xcom_push(key='tda_session_id', value=session_id)
```

Session ID stored in XCom. All tasks share context. Query 2 references Query 1—conversational follow-ups in batch mode.

**2. ASYNC SUBMIT + POLL**

```python
def submit_query(query_text, session_id):
    # Submit
    response = requests.post(
        f"{TDA_BASE_URL}/api/v1/query/submit",
        json={
            "query": query_text,
            "session_id": session_id,
            "profile_override": "@PROD"
        }
    )
    task_id = response.json()["task_id"]
    
    # Poll until complete
    while True:
        status = requests.get(
            f"{TDA_BASE_URL}/api/v1/query/status/{task_id}"
        ).json()
        
        if status["status"] == "completed":
            break
        elif status["status"] == "failed":
            raise Exception(f"Query failed: {status['error']}")
        
        time.sleep(5)
    
    # Retrieve results
    return requests.get(
        f"{TDA_BASE_URL}/api/v1/query/result/{task_id}"
    ).json()
```

No timeouts. No blocking. Graceful long-running query handling.

**3. PROFILE OVERRIDE PER TASK**

Morning batch: `@COST` (Gemini Flash, cheap)
Executive reports: `@OPUS` (Claude Opus, accurate)

Same infrastructure. Different profiles per workload.

**4. ERROR HANDLING + RETRIES**

```python
task = PythonOperator(
    task_id='query_revenue_analysis',
    python_callable=submit_query,
    op_kwargs={'query_text': 'What are monthly revenue trends?'},
    retries=3,
    retry_delay=timedelta(minutes=2)
)
```

Airflow auto-retries failures. MCP hiccup? LLM timeout? Handled.

**5. SCHEDULING**

```python
dag = DAG(
    'tda_execute_questions',
    schedule_interval='0 6 * * *',  # Daily 6 AM
    catchup=False
)
```

Cron scheduling. Manual trigger. API trigger. Upstream data trigger. Full flexibility.

**6. RESULTS DISTRIBUTION**

```python
def store_results(result, **context):
    s3.put_object(
        Bucket='analytics-reports',
        Key=f"daily_revenue_{context['ds']}.json",
        Body=json.dumps(result)
    )
```

Uderia: Intelligence. Airflow: Distribution.

**WATCH IT RUN:**

```
Task 1: Create session ✓ (XCom: session_id)
Task 2: Query "Top revenue products" ✓ (base_readQuery → fitness_db)
Task 3: Query "Customer demographics" ✓ (context from Task 2)
Task 4: Store to S3 ✓
```

Four tasks. One conversational workflow. Production-grade.

**THE SHIFT:**

Old: Notebook explorations → Manual engineering → Separate deployment

Uderia: Conversation → API → Airflow orchestration

Same agent. Same queries. Production reliability.

Conversational AI meets enterprise workflows.

## Module 3: TRANSPARENT - Eliminate the Black Box
**Goal:** Build trust through complete visibility into agent reasoning

### 3.1 Live Status Panel: Watch the Agent Think
**Duration:** 3-4 minutes  
**Learning Objectives:**
- Understand real-time agent reasoning visibility
- Learn to read strategic plans
- Recognize tactical decisions and tool selections

**Key Topics to Cover:**
- [ ] Live Status Panel components (Strategic Plan, Tactical Execution, Raw Data)
- [ ] Streaming updates via Server-Sent Events
- [ ] Phase-by-phase plan breakdown
- [ ] Tool selection rationale display
- [ ] Self-correction events

**Narration Script:**
```
Welcome to the feature that changes AI trust—the Live Status Panel.

**THE BLACK BOX PROBLEM:**

Most AI tools:
- You ask → You wait → You get answer
- What happened between? Unknown.
- Accurate data? Hallucination? Guesswork.

Uderia eliminates guesswork. Radical transparency.

**SCENARIO: Customer Support Director**

Complaints piling up. Need data.

Ask: *"Compare service ticket resolution times across product categories and identify quality issues."*

Complex query:
- Join ServiceTickets + Products
- Calculate time deltas
- Group by category  
- Infer quality patterns

Hit enter. Watch right panel.

**STRATEGIC PLAN APPEARS:**

```
Phase 1: Identify relevant tables (ServiceTickets, Products)
Phase 2: Calculate average resolution times by ProductType
Phase 3: Identify high-ticket products with slow resolution
Phase 4: Generate comparative analysis report
```

Not a loading spinner. A strategic blueprint.

Agent shows reasoning BEFORE executing. Validate approach before burning tokens.

**TACTICAL EXECUTION:**

**Phase 1:**

```
Tool: base_tableList
Arguments: {"database": "fitness_db"}
Rationale: "Verify ServiceTickets and Products tables exist"
```

Exact tool. Exact arguments. Exact reason. Zero ambiguity.

**Raw Data (click to expand):**

```json
{
  "tables": ["Customers", "Products", "Sales", "SaleDetails", "ServiceTickets"],
  "database": "fitness_db"
}
```

Complete visibility into agent's data sources.

**Phase 2:**

```
Tool: base_readQuery
SQL: 
  SELECT p.ProductType, 
         AVG(CAST(st.ResolutionDate - st.TicketDate AS INT)) as AvgResolutionDays
  FROM fitness_db.ServiceTickets st 
  JOIN fitness_db.Products p ON st.ProductID = p.ProductID
  WHERE st.ResolutionDate IS NOT NULL
  GROUP BY p.ProductType
  ORDER BY AvgResolutionDays DESC
Rationale: "Calculate average resolution time by product type"
```

Exact SQL visible. Spot logic issues immediately. No blind trust.

**Raw Results:**

```json
[
  {"ProductType": "Cardio", "AvgResolutionDays": 8.3},
  {"ProductType": "Strength", "AvgResolutionDays": 5.1},
  {"ProductType": "Accessories", "AvgResolutionDays": 2.7}
]
```

**Phase 3:**

```
Tool: TDA_LLMTask
Task: "Analyze which categories show quality issues based on ticket volume + resolution time"
Data: [resolution data + ticket counts]
Rationale: "Need LLM reasoning for pattern identification beyond metrics"
```

Delegated analytical reasoning. Decision made explicitly. Not hidden.

**SELF-CORRECTION (The Trust Builder):**

Agent tries wrong table:

```
Tool: base_readQuery
SQL: ...FROM ProductReturns...
❌ Error: "Table fitness_db.ProductReturns does not exist"
```

**RECOVERY:**

Live Status Panel shows:

```
🔄 Error detected. Replanning.
Strategy: Use ServiceTickets as quality proxy (ProductReturns unavailable)
New approach: Query ServiceTickets grouped by ProductID for complaint patterns
```

```
Tool: base_readQuery (corrected)
SQL: ...FROM ServiceTickets GROUP BY ProductID...
✅ Success
```

**WHAT JUST HAPPENED:**

Agent failed → Recognized failure → Replanned → Succeeded

All visible. All transparent.

**CONTRAST:**

Traditional AI: Generic error or hallucinated answer
Uderia: Think → Execute → Detect → Self-correct (all visible)

**THE IMPACT:**

Live Status Panel = Radical visibility

Every decision. Every tool call. Every data source. Every recovery.

No black boxes. No guesswork.

Complete trust through complete transparency.
```

- `dba_systemHealth` - Check resource utilization
- `dba_userActivity` - Monitor user sessions

Each tool shows:
1. Exact name agent uses
2. Clear description
3. Arguments (required vs optional - hover for details)

Not documentation. Real-time inventory of current capabilities.

**2. PROMPTS TAB**

Pre-built complex workflows. Invoke like specialized team members.

**Business Intelligence:**

- `base_databaseBusinessDesc` - Business context for database
  - Args: database_name (required), detail_level (optional)
  - Returns: Purpose, entities, use cases

  - Returns: Resource usage, performance, alerts

- `dba_userActivityAnalysis` - User behavior patterns
  - Args: time_range (optional, default: 24h)
  - Returns: Active users, query volumes, resource usage

Instead of complex multi-step queries, invoke prompts that know the workflow.

**3. RESOURCES TAB**

Data sources + knowledge repositories:

- Database connections (e.g., fitness_db on Teradata)
- API endpoints (if configured)
- Knowledge collections (uploaded docs)
- External tools (if integrated)

**DYNAMIC CAPABILITY UPDATES:**

Add new capability:

Setup → MCP Servers → Add New Server

Example: PostgreSQL for cross-database analysis

```
Name: "Analytics PostgreSQL"
Host: analytics-db.company.com
Port: 5432
Path: /mcp
```

Save. Add to profile.

Capabilities Panel refreshes (auto or manual).

New tools appear:
- `postgres_queryExecute`
- `postgres_schemaIntrospect`
- `postgres_tableSample`

Agent immediately knows. No restart. Dynamic discovery.

Now ask: *"Compare revenue trends in Teradata production vs PostgreSQL analytics models."*

Agent sees both:
- `base_readQuery` (Teradata)
- `postgres_queryExecute` (PostgreSQL)

Orchestrates cross-database analysis automatically.

**CAPABILITY FILTERING:**

Disable expensive tool:

Setup → Capabilities Management → Tools
Find `base_tableDDL` → Toggle OFF

Capabilities Panel: Tool turns gray ("Disabled")

Ask: *"Show me Products table structure."*

Agent uses alternatives:
- `qlty_dataProfile`
- INFORMATION_SCHEMA query

`base_tableDDL` unavailable → Agent adapts.

Re-enable → Back in action.

**THE POWER:**

Dynamic capability management. Real-time control. No code.

Capabilities Panel = Window into agent potential.

Every tool. Every prompt. Every resource. Visible. Managed.

### 3.3 Context Management: Control Agent Memory
**Duration:** 3-4 minutes  
**Learning Objectives:**
- Master turn activation/deactivation
- Understand context purge vs selective memory
- Learn query replay functionality

**Key Topics to Cover:**
- [ ] Turn-level context control (checkboxes)
- [ ] Full Context vs Turn Summaries modes
- [ ] Context purge for memory reset
- [ ] Query replay for alternative approaches
- [ ] Context indicator real-time status

**Narration Script:**
```
Most underappreciated AI feature: Context management—controlling what the agent remembers.

Uderia: Surgical precision over agent memory.

**TURN HISTORY PANEL:**

Session History (below conversation). Every query-response = "turn" with checkbox.

**Current conversation:**

```
Turn 1: ✓ "What are the top 5 products by revenue?"
Turn 2: ✓ "Show customer demographics for those products"
Turn 3: ✓ "Which states have the highest sales?"
Turn 4: ✓ "What's the average ticket resolution time?"
```

All checked = All active in context.

**SELECTIVE MEMORY:**

Uncheck Turn 1.

Context indicator updates: "3 turns active"

Ask: *"What are the top selling products this week?"*

Agent treats as fresh question. Turn 1 deactivated = Not referenced.

Turns 2-4 still available if needed.

**WHY THIS MATTERS:**

Exploration mistake:
- Asked about "Product X"
- Meant "Product Y"

Traditional AI: Carries mistake through entire conversation

Uderia: Uncheck wrong turn → Never happened → Clean continuation

**CONTEXT MODES:**

Top bar toggle: "Full Context" vs "Turn Summaries"

**Full Context (default):**
- Every active turn's complete text → LLM
- High token usage
- Maximum accuracy

**Turn Summaries:**
- Only summaries sent
- Lower token cost  
- Slightly less detail

Switch to Turn Summaries. Ask: *"What patterns do you see across our conversation?"*

Agent receives:

```
- Turn 1 summary: "Top products by revenue"
- Turn 2 summary: "Customer demographics request"
- Turn 3 summary: "Geographic sales distribution"
- Turn 4 summary: "Service ticket resolution times"
```

Reasoning maintained. 70% fewer tokens.

Long exploratory sessions (dozens of questions): Turn Summaries = Significant cost savings.

**CONTEXT PURGE:**

Fresh start WITHOUT creating new session (preserves history + tool results).

Click "Purge Context" → Confirm

All checkboxes uncheck. Context indicator: "0 turns active"

Agent has zero conversational memory. Every query = Brand new.

History still visible. Reactivate turns selectively.

**QUERY REPLAY:**

Turn 2 gave interesting results. Want different angle?

Three-dot menu (Turn 2) → "Replay Query"

Original question appears: *"Show customer demographics for those products."*

Modify it: *"Show customer demographics AND purchasing patterns for those products."*

Hit enter.

Agent executes with Turn 2 context (Turn 1 still active) + enhanced question.

Becomes Turn 5.

Alternative path explored. Original results preserved.

**CONTEXT INDICATOR:**

Top right - real-time status:

```
"4/5 turns active (2,340 tokens)"
```

Tells you:
- 4 of 5 turns providing context
- Current context size: 2,340 tokens
- Exact token count sent to LLM

**ADVANCED USE CASE:**

Complex analysis: 20 turns

```
Turns 1-5: Data exploration (messy)
Turns 6-15: Deep analysis (focused)
Turns 16-20: Final synthesis (polished)
```

Goal: Clean summary without exploratory noise.

Strategy:
- Deactivate Turns 1-5
- Keep Turns 6-20 active

Ask: *"Summarize our key findings."*

Agent generates summary from:
- Deep analysis (6-15)
- Final synthesis (16-20)

Exploratory phase excluded. Context clean.

**THE POWER:**

Surgical control over agent memory.

Context = Tool (not limitation)

No other platform: This precision.

Uderia: Context management = First-class feature.

Real-world workflows: What agent remembers = As important as what it can do.

Memory precision + Cost control + Exploratory freedom.

All in your hands.
```

**Screen Capture Plan:**
- [ ] Session History panel showing 4 turns with checkboxes (all checked)
- [ ] Context indicator showing "4 turns active"
- [ ] Uncheck Turn 1 → Context indicator updates to "3 turns active"
- [ ] New query asked with Turn 1 deactivated

### 3.4 System Customization: Shape Agent Behavior
**Duration:** 3-4 minutes  
**Learning Objectives:**
- Edit system prompts for custom behavior
- Test baseline LLM without tools
- Manage capability enable/disable

**Key Topics to Cover:**
- [ ] System Prompt Editor access
- [ ] Per-model instruction customization
- [ ] Save and reset capabilities
- [ ] Direct Model Chat for baseline testing
- [ ] Dynamic capability management (tools/prompts)

**Narration Script:**
```
Transparency = Seeing what agent does.
Customization = Controlling HOW it behaves.

Uderia: Deep customization. No proprietary walls.

**SYSTEM PROMPT EDITOR:**

Setup → Advanced → System Prompts

Actual system instructions. Guide agent behavior.

Organized by provider:

```
- MASTER_SYSTEM_PROMPT (Universal)
- GOOGLE_MASTER_SYSTEM_PROMPT (Gemini optimizations)
- OLLAMA_MASTER_SYSTEM_PROMPT (Local model adaptations)
```

Click "Edit" on MASTER_SYSTEM_PROMPT:

```
You are an enterprise data intelligence agent with tools and knowledge.

Your role:
1. Decompose queries into strategic phases
2. Select optimal tools per phase
3. Execute with precision, self-correct on errors
4. Provide structured, actionable insights

Planning:
- Break complex requests into clear phases
- Identify required tools before execution
- Consider data dependencies
- Anticipate errors

[...more...]
```

This is the agent's brain. Editable.

**CUSTOMIZE REASONING:**

Add verbosity:

```
When selecting tools, always explain:
- Why this tool is best
- What alternatives you considered
- What you expect returned
```

Save. Ask: *"What are the top revenue products?"*

**Before:**
```
Tool selected: base_readQuery
```

**After:**
```
Tool selected: base_readQuery
Rationale: Direct SQL execution optimal for revenue aggregation.
Alternatives: base_tableList (insufficient—structure only), 
              qlty_dataProfile (unnecessary—not quality query)
Expected: Table with ProductName, Revenue (sorted desc)
```

You customized agent communication by editing system prompt.

**PROVIDER-SPECIFIC PROMPTS:**

Gemini ≠ Claude ≠ GPT-4. Optimizations differ.

GOOGLE_MASTER_SYSTEM_PROMPT:

```
Function calling: Structure arguments as clear JSON
Gemini strength: Parallel tool execution
Identify opportunities for simultaneous tool calls
```

Provider-specific tuning = Optimal performance per model.

**SAVE AND RESET:**

```
Save to Overrides: Stores in prompt_overrides/ (persists across updates)
Reset to Default: Revert to baseline
```

**DIRECT MODEL CHAT:**

Test raw LLM. No tools. No agent logic.

Setup → Advanced → Direct Model Chat

Ask: *"What are the top revenue products?"*

**LLM Response:**
```
"I don't have database access. Provide data or run query."
```

Baseline = No tooling.

Switch back to agent mode. Same question:

**Agent Response:**
```
Actual data from fitness_db via base_readQuery:
1. Treadmill Pro 3000 - $45,230
2. Elliptical Elite - $38,900
...
```

Comparison shows orchestration layer value:
- Tool access
- Context management
- Execution planning

**DYNAMIC CAPABILITY MANAGEMENT:**

Setup → Capabilities → Tools

```
✓ base_databaseList (Enabled)
✓ base_tableList (Enabled)
✓ base_tableDDL (Enabled)
✓ base_readQuery (Enabled)
```

Experiment: Disable `base_readQuery`

Toggle OFF → Confirm

```
✗ base_readQuery (Disabled)
```

Ask: *"Top 5 products by revenue?"*

**Live Status Panel:**
```
❌ ERROR: base_readQuery unavailable
🔄 Replanning: Use base_tableList + TDA_LLMTask for schema insights
⚠️ Query fails or produces workaround
```

Re-enable → Toggle ON

Same question → ✅ Succeeds instantly

**USE CASES:**
- Test agent without specific tools
- Restrict expensive tools (cost control)
- Disable problematic tools (debugging)
- Phase in new tools gradually

No restart. No code edits. Dynamic.

**PROMPT MANAGEMENT:**

Setup → Capabilities → Prompts

Disable `base_databaseBusinessDesc`

Ask: *"Business overview of fitness_db?"*

Agent falls back: `base_tableList` + `base_tableDDL` (manual investigation)

Re-enable → Efficient pre-built workflow returns

**THE SHIFT:**

Most AI platforms: Proprietary secrets. Take what they give.

Uderia: Full keys.
- Edit system prompts
- Test raw models
- Enable/disable capabilities dynamically

Not just transparency. CONTROL.

Your agent. Your rules. Your customization.

Trust through visibility. Power through customization.

## Module 4: EFFICIENT - The Fusion Optimizer
**Goal:** Showcase the revolutionary optimization engine and self-learning capabilities

### 4.1 Strategic & Tactical Planning Architecture
**Duration:** 4-5 minutes  
**Learning Objectives:**
- Understand multi-layered planning process
- See strategic meta-plans in action
- Grasp recursive delegation concept

**Key Topics to Cover:**
- [ ] Strategic Planner (high-level meta-plan)
- [ ] Tactical Execution (best next action)
- [ ] Recursive delegation for complex problems
- [ ] Phase-by-phase breakdown visualization
- [ ] Plan vs execution distinction

**Narration Script:**
```
Welcome to Uderia's heart—the **Fusion Optimizer**.

LLM wrapper → Enterprise AI orchestration engine. This is the transform.

**MOST AI TOOLS:**
```
User asks → Model responds → Repeat

No planning. No optimization. No intelligence in execution.
```

**FUSION OPTIMIZER:**
```
Strategic planning + Tactical execution + Continuous optimization

Multi-layered architecture. Enterprise-grade intelligence.
```

**SCENARIO: Q4 Board Meeting Prep**

CEO wants: Why revenue missed + What actions to take.

**Traditional setup requires:**
```
1. BI Analyst     → Pull sales data
2. Data Engineer  → Correlate service data
3. Business Analyst → Synthesize insights
4. Executive      → Frame recommendations

Multiple specialists. Days of coordination.
```

**Uderia:**
```
One intelligent workflow. All perspectives orchestrated.
```

Profile: @ANALYST (business knowledge + reporting patterns + visualization tools)

Ask: *"Analyze fitness equipment business: identify declining product categories, investigate service patterns, recommend improvements."*

Watch Live Status Panel.

**STRATEGIC PLANNING LAYER:**

Agent doesn't just execute. First: Generates meta-plan (strategic blueprint):

```
STRATEGIC META-PLAN:

Phase 1: Identify declining product categories
  Requires: Sales, SaleDetails tables
  Output: Categories with negative growth
  Dependencies: None (execute immediately)

Phase 2: Analyze service ticket patterns
  Requires: ServiceTickets + Phase 1 results
  Output: Ticket volume, resolution times, issues
  Dependencies: Phase 1

Phase 3: Correlate sales decline + service issues
  Requires: Phase 1 + Phase 2 results
  Output: Root cause analysis
  Dependencies: Phases 1, 2

Phase 4: Generate actionable recommendations
  Requires: All analysis
  Output: Prioritized strategies
  Dependencies: All phases
```

Strategic thinking. Entire workflow mapped BEFORE executing single tool.

**TACTICAL EXECUTION LAYER:**

Phase 1 execution begins.

Strategic planner → Tactical executor: "Complete Phase 1"

Tactical layer asks: "Best next action?"

**Tactical Decision:**
```
Goal: Identify declining categories
Action: SQL query comparing Q4 vs Q3 sales by ProductType
Tool: base_readQuery
Rationale: Single query captures current + previous quarter,
           calculates growth %, identifies decline efficiently
```

**SQL Generated:**
```sql
SELECT p.ProductType,
       SUM(CASE WHEN QUARTER(s.SaleDate) = CURRENT_QUARTER 
           THEN sd.Quantity * sd.UnitPrice ELSE 0 END) as CurrentQ,
       SUM(CASE WHEN QUARTER(s.SaleDate) = CURRENT_QUARTER-1
           THEN sd.Quantity * sd.UnitPrice ELSE 0 END) as PrevQ,
       ((CurrentQ - PrevQ) / PrevQ * 100) as GrowthPct
FROM Products p
JOIN SaleDetails sd ON p.ProductID = sd.ProductID
JOIN Sales s ON sd.SaleID = s.SaleID
WHERE s.SaleDate >= '2024-07-01'
GROUP BY p.ProductType
ORDER BY GrowthPct ASC;
```

Tactical precision. Optimal tool + approach for this step.

**Results:**
```json
[
  {"ProductType": "Cardio", "CurrentQ": 125000, "PrevQ": 180000, "GrowthPct": -30.5},
  {"ProductType": "Accessories", "CurrentQ": 45000, "PrevQ": 52000, "GrowthPct": -13.5},
  {"ProductType": "Strength", "CurrentQ": 200000, "PrevQ": 190000, "GrowthPct": 5.3}
]
```

✅ Phase 1 complete. Cardio: -30.5% | Accessories: -13.5%

**RECURSIVE DELEGATION:**

Phase 2: "Analyze service ticket patterns for declining products"

Complex phase requires:
```
1. Get tickets for Cardio + Accessories
2. Calculate avg resolution times
3. Categorize issue types
4. Identify patterns
```

Strategic planner doesn't handle monolithically.

Delegates to NEW subordinate planner instance.

**Recursive sub-plan appears:**
```
SUB-PLAN for Phase 2:
  2.1: Retrieve product IDs for Cardio and Accessories categories
  2.2: Query ServiceTickets for those product IDs
  2.3: Calculate resolution time statistics
  2.4: Extract and categorize issue descriptions
```

This sub-planner operates independently, executes its sub-phases, and returns consolidated 
results to the parent planner.

The parent doesn't micromanage. It delegated a complex sub-task to a specialized instance, 
which broke it down further and solved it.

**This is recursive intelligence.**

Sub-Plan 2.1 executes:
```
Tool: base_readQuery
SQL: SELECT ProductID FROM fitness_db.Products WHERE ProductType IN ('Cardio', 'Accessories')
Result: 47 product IDs identified
```

Sub-Plan 2.2 executes:
```
Tool: base_readQuery  
SQL: SELECT ProductID, COUNT(*) as TicketCount, 
            AVG(CAST(ResolutionDate - TicketDate AS INT)) as AvgResolutionDays,
            IssueDescription
     FROM fitness_db.ServiceTickets
     WHERE ProductID IN (list of 47 IDs)
     GROUP BY ProductID
Result: Service patterns retrieved
```

Sub-Plan 2.3 executes:
```
Tool: TDA_LLMTask
Task: "Analyze resolution time distribution and identify outliers"
Result: Cardio products average 8.3 days to resolve vs 2.7 for Accessories
```

Sub-Plan 2.4 executes:
```
Tool: TDA_LLMTask
Task: "Categorize issue descriptions into common themes"
Result: Top issues for Cardio: Motor failures (45%), Belt wear (30%), Electronic issues (25%)
```

Sub-plan complete. Results return to parent Phase 2. Phase 2 marks complete.

**HIERARCHICAL PROBLEM SOLVING:**

Phase 3 begins: "Correlate sales decline with service issues."

This phase uses results from BOTH Phase 1 and Phase 2. The strategic planner has those 
results in context.

Tactical execution:
```
Tool: TDA_LLMTask
Task: "Analyze correlation between 30% Cardio sales decline and 8.3-day average 
       service resolution time with 45% motor failure rate. Determine causation likelihood."
Result: Strong correlation. Customer reviews and repeat purchase rates show service 
        experience directly impacts sales. Motor failures driving negative sentiment.
```

Phase 3 complete.

Phase 4 begins: "Generate actionable recommendations."

```
Tool: TDA_FinalReport
Arguments: All prior phase results
Task: Synthesize insights into prioritized recommendations
Result: 
  1. URGENT: Address motor quality issues in Cardio line (root cause)
  2. HIGH: Reduce service resolution time target to <5 days (customer experience)
  3. MEDIUM: Implement proactive outreach for products >6 months old (prevention)
```

Final answer delivered to the user.

**WHAT HAPPENED:**

Complex question decomposed into:
```
✓ 4-phase strategic meta-plan
✓ Tactical tool selections per phase
✓ Recursive sub-plan for Phase 2
✓ Data gathering → Analysis → Correlation → Synthesis
✓ Actionable recommendations
```

All autonomous. All visible. All optimized.

**THE DISTINCTION:**

```
Chatbot: User asks → Model responds
Uderia:  Strategic planning → Tactical execution → Recursive delegation
```

Enterprise AI orchestration engine.

**FUSION OPTIMIZER =**
```
Strategic planning + Tactical execution
Recursive delegation + Hierarchical problem-solving
```

**WHY IT MATTERS:**

Uderia: Enterprise complexity ✓
Other tools: Simple Q&A only

Intelligence in architecture. Not just model.

Click case: "Revenue Analysis - Top Products by Category"

```
CASE: Revenue Analysis - Top Products by Category

Query: "Top 5 products by revenue in each category?"

Strategic Plan:
  Phase 1: Revenue aggregation with category grouping
  Phase 2: Format results

Tool Trace:
  1. base_readQuery (1.8s)
     SQL: SELECT ProductType, ProductName, Brand,
                 SUM(Quantity * UnitPrice) as Revenue,
                 RANK() OVER (PARTITION BY ProductType 
                              ORDER BY Revenue DESC) as Rank
          FROM Products p
          JOIN SaleDetails sd ON p.ProductID = sd.ProductID
          WHERE Rank <= 5
          GROUP BY ProductType, ProductName, Brand
     Result: 15 rows (5 per category)
  
  2. TDA_FinalReport
     Format: Grouped table
     Result: Clean output

Tokens:
  Planning: 1,200 in / 95 out
  Execution: 850 in / 120 out
  Total: 2,265

Cost: $0.0112

Efficiency Score: 94/100
  ✓ Optimal tool selection
  ✓ Minimal tokens
  ✓ Single-pass
  ✓ No errors/retries

Champion Case: YES 🏆 (lowest tokens for pattern)
```

Entire workflow → Reusable pattern.

**EFFICIENCY ANALYSIS:**

Score: 94/100. RAG analyzes every case:

```
Token Efficiency:    Minimal tokens?
Execution Efficiency: Single-pass?
Tool Selection:      Optimal choices?
Strategic Planning:  Direct path?
```

Cases ranked. Most efficient = **Champion Case 🏆**

List shows champion badges.

**CHAMPION STRATEGY SELECTION:**

Let's say we have three cases for "top revenue queries":

1. Revenue by Product (Champion 🏆) - 2,265 tokens, 1.8s, score 94
2. Revenue by Category - 3,100 tokens, 3.2s, score 78  
3. Revenue with Customer Analysis - 5,800 tokens, 7.5s, score 65

Case 1 is the champion—most efficient for straightforward revenue queries.

When a new similar query comes in, the RAG system will inject Case 1 as a few-shot 
example to guide the strategic planner.

**FEW-SHOT LEARNING INJECTION:**

New similar query: *"Show me top revenue products by brand this month."*

Live Status Panel → Strategic planning shows:

**🔍 RAG-RETRIEVED CONTEXT:**

```
Similar Past Cases:

1. Revenue Analysis - Top Products by Category (similarity: 0.89)
   Strategy: Single aggregation + grouping
   Tools: base_readQuery → TDA_FinalReport
   Tokens: 2,265 | Cost: $0.0112 | Duration: 1.8s
   Key: RANK() window function for top-N per group

2. Monthly Revenue Trends (similarity: 0.76)
   Strategy: Time-based filtering + SUM
   Tools: base_readQuery → TDA_FinalReport
   Tokens: 1,980 | Cost: $0.0095 | Duration: 1.5s
   Key: EXTRACT(MONTH) for current month filter
```

Strategic planner learns from champions:
```
Case 1 → Use RANK() for top-N per group
Case 2 → Use EXTRACT(MONTH) for monthly filter
Combine both patterns
```

Strategic plan generated:
```
Phase 1: Execute revenue query by brand for current month using optimized SQL pattern
  Tool: base_readQuery
  SQL: SELECT p.Brand, p.ProductName,
              SUM(sd.Quantity * sd.UnitPrice) as Revenue,
              RANK() OVER (PARTITION BY p.Brand ORDER BY Revenue DESC) as Rank
       FROM fitness_db.Products p
       JOIN fitness_db.SaleDetails sd ON p.ProductID = sd.ProductID  
       JOIN fitness_db.Sales s ON sd.SaleID = s.SaleID
       WHERE EXTRACT(MONTH FROM s.SaleDate) = EXTRACT(MONTH FROM CURRENT_DATE)
         AND Rank <= 5
       GROUP BY p.Brand, p.ProductName

Phase 2: Format results
  Tool: TDA_FinalReport
```

Look at that—the agent learned the RANK() pattern from past success. It didn't waste 
time exploring alternative approaches. It went straight to the proven champion strategy.

Execution completes.

Token usage: 2,180 total (85 fewer than the first time we solved this pattern)
Cost: $0.0106 (saved $0.0006)
Duration: 1.6s (0.2s faster)

**CONTINUOUS IMPROVEMENT:**

New execution analyzed:
```
Succeeded?              YES
More efficient?         YES (fewer tokens, faster)
Become new champion?    YES
```

RAG auto-promotes to champion.

Next similar query → Benefits from even-more-optimized approach.

**THE EVOLUTION:**
```
Agent learning: Continuous
Getting faster: Automatic
Getting cheaper: Automatic
```

**ASYNCHRONOUS PROCESSING:**

Does RAG slow responses?

**No. Watch timeline:**

```
[00:00.000] User submits query
[00:00.050] RAG retrieval starts (parallel)
[00:00.100] Strategic planner invoked
[00:00.350] RAG context injected ✓
[00:00.400] Strategic plan finalized
[00:00.450] Tactical execution begins
[00:02.100] Results → User
------- USER HAS ANSWER -------
[00:02.150] Async: Case archiving (background)
[00:03.500] Async: Efficiency analysis (background)
[00:03.600] Async: Case stored (background)
```

RAG retrieval: During planning (<300ms)
Case archiving: After user gets answer

Zero user-facing latency.

**PER-USER COST SAVINGS ATTRIBUTION:**

Go to Intelligence → Efficiency Metrics.

You'll see a dashboard:

```
YOUR RAG EFFICIENCY GAINS:

Total Queries: 247
RAG-Guided Queries: 183 (74%)

Token Savings:
  Without RAG (projected): 892,000 tokens
  With RAG (actual): 645,000 tokens  
  Savings: 247,000 tokens (28% reduction)

Cost Savings:
  Projected cost: $52.30
  Actual cost: $37.60
  Savings: $14.70 (28% reduction)

Time Savings:
  Average execution time without RAG: 4.2s
  Average execution time with RAG: 2.8s
  Per-query savings: 1.4s (33% faster)
```

The RAG system isn't just making the agent smarter—it's making it dramatically more 
cost-effective. And these savings compound as your repository grows.

**KNOWLEDGE TRANSFER & PERSONA-BOUND LEARNING:**

Here's the organizational benefit—and it gets even more powerful with profiles.

When you use the @DBA profile to optimize a complex join query, that champion case 
gets stored in the DBA persona's planner repository. The next time ANYONE switches to 
@DBA, they inherit that optimized pattern. Your database expertise becomes the DBA 
persona's expertise.

When your colleague uses @ANALYST to create an executive dashboard, that visualization 
pattern gets captured. Now the @ANALYST persona has learned a new reporting style. 
Every user of that profile benefits.

When the quality team uses @QUALITY to validate data, those validation workflows become 
part of the Quality persona's playbook.

This is collective intelligence at work—not just across users, but across specialized 
personas. Each profile evolves independently:
- @DBA gets better at SQL optimization
- @ANALYST gets better at business insights  
- @QUALITY gets better at data validation
- @LOCAL maintains same patterns with sovereign execution

You're not just improving one agent. You're building a library of specialized expert 
personas, each learning from every user's successes in their domain.

Switch profiles. Switch to the persona that learned from your team's best work. 
Orchestrate expertise that compounds over time.

**CROSS-TIER KNOWLEDGE TRANSFER: Train on Premium, Execute on Budget**

Here's the ultimate cost optimization strategy: use expensive intelligence to teach, 
then use cheap execution to repeat.

Let's demonstrate with a complex analytical challenge that would normally require a 
premium model.

**Phase 1: Learning with @OPUS (Claude Opus - Premium)**

Switch to @OPUS profile. This is the most expensive, most capable model—$15 per 1M 
input tokens. But we're going to use it strategically.

Ask a genuinely complex question:

"Analyze the relationship between customer demographics (age, location), product purchase 
patterns, service ticket frequency, and revenue contribution to identify high-value 
customer segments and predict churn risk."

This requires sophisticated reasoning:
- Multi-table joins (Customers, Sales, SaleDetails, Products, ServiceTickets)
- Statistical analysis (correlation, clustering)
- Pattern recognition (churn indicators)
- Segmentation logic (defining high-value cohorts)

Watch @OPUS work. The Live Status Panel shows:

```
Profile: @OPUS (Claude Opus)
Cost Tier: Premium ($15/$75 per 1M tokens)

Strategic Plan (6 phases):
  Phase 1: Aggregate customer purchase history
  Phase 2: Join service ticket patterns
  Phase 3: Calculate customer lifetime value
  Phase 4: Perform demographic clustering
  Phase 5: Identify churn risk indicators
  Phase 6: Generate segmentation report

Tool Executions:
  - base_readQuery (3 complex multi-table joins)
  - TDA_LLMTask (statistical analysis)
  - TDA_LLMTask (clustering algorithm)
  - TDA_FinalReport (executive summary)

Execution:
  Tokens: 12,400 (input) + 2,300 (output) = 14,700 total
  Cost: $0.3585
  Duration: 8.7s
  Result: HIGH QUALITY - Sophisticated segmentation with 5 distinct customer cohorts
```

Expensive? Yes. But brilliant. Opus identified patterns a simpler model would miss.

**Champion Case Captured:**

The RAG system analyzes this execution:

```
Case: "Customer Segmentation with Churn Prediction"
Profile: @OPUS
Efficiency Score: 91/100
  - Complex reasoning: ✓ (required premium model)
  - Optimal tool selection: ✓
  - Minimal retries: ✓
  - High-quality output: ✓

Champion Case: YES
Pattern Captured:
  - Strategic approach: Multi-phase with clustering
  - Tool sequence: Aggregation → Join → Calculate → Analyze → Report
  - SQL patterns: Complex CTEs with window functions
  - Analysis techniques: Demographic clustering, churn indicators

Stored in: DBA_Champion_Cases + ANALYST_Champion_Cases
(This pattern is valuable for both database optimization and business analysis)
```

We just paid $0.36 to solve this problem brilliantly. But that investment is about to 
pay massive dividends.

**Phase 2: Execution with @COST (Gemini Flash - Budget)**

Now switch to @COST profile. This is the cheapest model available—$0.075 per 1M input 
tokens. That's 200x cheaper than Opus for input, 125x cheaper for output.

Ask a similar question (not identical, but same pattern):

"Identify high-value customer segments for our Strength equipment line and predict 
which segments are at churn risk."

Watch the magic happen. The Live Status Panel shows:

```
Profile: @COST (Gemini 1.5 Flash)
Cost Tier: Budget ($0.075/$0.30 per 1M tokens)

🔍 RAG-RETRIEVED CONTEXT:

Champion Case Found: "Customer Segmentation with Churn Prediction"
  - Similarity: 0.94 (excellent match)
  - Source Profile: @OPUS
  - Original Cost: $0.3585
  - Strategy: Multi-phase clustering with churn analysis
  - Tools: base_readQuery (aggregations) → TDA_LLMTask (clustering) → TDA_FinalReport
  - SQL Pattern: CTEs with window functions for lifetime value calculation
  - Analysis Pattern: Demographic clustering → Service pattern correlation → Churn scoring

Applying learned strategy...

Strategic Plan (6 phases - INHERITED FROM OPUS):
  Phase 1: Aggregate customer purchase history (Strength products filter)
  Phase 2: Join service ticket patterns
  Phase 3: Calculate customer lifetime value
  Phase 4: Perform demographic clustering
  Phase 5: Identify churn risk indicators
  Phase 6: Generate segmentation report

Tool Executions (SAME SEQUENCE AS OPUS):
  - base_readQuery (using Opus-optimized SQL patterns)
  - TDA_LLMTask (following Opus analysis structure)
  - TDA_LLMTask (applying Opus clustering approach)
  - TDA_FinalReport (matching Opus report format)

Execution:
  Tokens: 8,200 (input) + 1,850 (output) = 10,050 total
  Cost: $0.0123
  Duration: 5.1s
  Result: HIGH QUALITY - Sophisticated segmentation with 4 distinct customer cohorts
```

Look at what just happened:

**Cost Comparison:**
- @OPUS: $0.3585 (to learn the pattern)
- @COST: $0.0123 (to execute the learned pattern)
- **Savings: $0.3462 per query (96.5% cost reduction)**

**Quality Comparison:**
- @OPUS: 5 customer cohorts, sophisticated clustering
- @COST: 4 customer cohorts, nearly identical insights
- **Quality preservation: ~95% of Opus quality at 3.5% of Opus cost**

**The ROI Calculation:**

If you run this type of analysis monthly:
- Without RAG: 12 queries × $0.3585 = $4.30/year (all @OPUS)
- With RAG Transfer: 1 query × $0.3585 + 11 queries × $0.0123 = $0.4938/year
- **Annual Savings: $3.80 (88.5% cost reduction)**

If you run it weekly:
- Without RAG: 52 queries × $0.3585 = $18.64/year
- With RAG Transfer: 1 query × $0.3585 + 51 queries × $0.0123 = $0.9858/year  
- **Annual Savings: $17.65 (94.7% cost reduction)**

**The Strategy:**

1. Use premium models (@OPUS, @SONNET) to solve complex problems ONCE
2. RAG captures the champion strategy automatically
3. Use budget models (@COST, @GEMINI_FLASH) for subsequent similar queries
4. Budget models inherit premium intelligence via few-shot learning
5. Pay premium prices for intelligence, budget prices for execution

**Cross-Profile Learning at Scale:**

This works across ANY profile combination:

- **@OPUS → @ANALYST:** Learn complex business analysis, execute cheaply for routine reports
- **@SONNET → @DBA:** Learn SQL optimization, execute with local Ollama for free
- **@OPUS → @QUALITY:** Learn sophisticated anomaly detection, execute routinely at low cost
- **Premium Cloud → @LOCAL:** Learn in cloud, execute sovereignly on-premises

The expensive model teaches. The cheap model learns. Your organization gets premium 
intelligence at budget prices.

**Organizational Knowledge Compounding:**

As your team uses premium profiles occasionally for hard problems, the RAG repositories 
fill with high-quality champion cases. Over time, your budget profiles become incredibly 
capable—not because the underlying LLM improved, but because they're standing on the 
shoulders of premium model intelligence.

This is cross-tier knowledge transfer. This is how you optimize costs without sacrificing 
quality.

Train with genius. Execute with efficiency. Compound organizational intelligence.

**THE TRANSFORMATION:**

```
Individual success      → Organizational knowledge
One-time execution      → Reusable patterns
Static AI               → Self-improving intelligence

Train with genius       → Execute with efficiency
Premium model teaches   → Budget model learns
Expensive intelligence  → Cheap execution
```

**RAG-POWERED FUSION OPTIMIZER:**

Agent that gets smarter every time you use it.

Continuous improvement. Organizational learning. Cross-tier knowledge transfer.

This is intelligence that compounds.

### 4.3 Proactive Optimization: Fast Paths & Hydration
**Duration:** 3-4 minutes  
**Learning Objectives:**
- Learn plan hydration mechanism
- Understand tactical fast path
- See specialized orchestrators in action

**Key Topics to Cover:**
- [ ] Plan hydration (reusing previous turn data)
- [ ] Tactical fast path (skip LLM for simple operations)
- [ ] Specialized orchestrators (date range, comparative analysis)
- [ ] Context distillation for large datasets
- [ ] Optimization impact on speed and cost

**Narration Script:**
```
Fusion Optimizer: Plans + Learns + **Hunts for optimization opportunities**

Proactive optimization. Before execution. During execution.

Make Uderia fast. Make Uderia cost-effective.

**TECHNIQUE 1: PLAN HYDRATION**

Query: *"Top 5 products by revenue this month?"*

Execution:
```
Strategic Plan: Single phase
Tool: base_readQuery
Result: 5 products + revenue
Tokens: 1,800
Duration: 2.1s
```

Results displayed.

Immediate follow-up: *"What about the top 10?"*

Live Status Panel → Watch carefully:

```
🔧 PLAN HYDRATION DETECTED

New: "Top 10?"
Analysis: Expanded version of previous query

Previous results cached:
  Query: Top 5 products by revenue
  Tool: base_readQuery
  Results: 5 products
  Age: 3s (fresh)

Strategy: HYDRATE with cached data
  ✓ Skip Phase 1 planning (reuse strategy)
  ✓ Skip redundant call (modify LIMIT 5 → 10)
  ✓ Execute optimized query

Savings: ~900 tokens, ~$0.005, ~1.2s
```

Agent recognizes iterative refinement. Reuses context vs starting over.

**Result:**
```
Tokens: 950 (850 fewer)
Duration: 0.9s (1.2s faster)
Cost: $0.0045 ($0.005 saved)
```

**Common triggers:**
- "What about X instead?" (parameter change)
- "Show me more" (pagination)
- "Add Y" (incremental)
- "Break down by Z" (granularity)

**TECHNIQUE 2: TACTICAL FAST PATH**

Query: *"What's the current date?"*

Live Status Panel:

No strategic planning. No LLM call.

```
⚡ TACTICAL FAST PATH

Query: "Current date?"
Complexity: TRIVIAL (single deterministic tool)

Strategy: BYPASS strategic planning
  ✗ Skip planner LLM
  ✓ Direct tool invocation
  Tool: TDA_CurrentDate
  Args: {}

Savings: ~1,500 tokens, ~$0.008, ~0.8s
```

Instant recognition: Trivial query. Single tool. No args. No planning.

**Direct execution:**
```
Tool: TDA_CurrentDate
Result: "2025-12-07"
Time: 0.2s
```

No strategic plan. No tactical LLM. Pure efficiency.

**Triggers:**
- Single deterministic tool
- Arguments inferrable
- No multi-step logic

Eliminate ~1,500 tokens per fast-path query. Massive savings for conversational UIs.

**TECHNIQUE 3: SPECIALIZED ORCHESTRATORS**

Query: *"Show daily sales for past week."*

The agent detects a pattern:

```
🎯 OPTIMIZATION: DATE RANGE ORCHESTRATOR

Query: "daily sales for the past week"
Pattern detected: Time-series iteration over date range

Standard approach:
  - Plan each day as separate phase (7 phases)
  - Execute 7 individual queries
  - Tokens: ~12,000 | Duration: ~15s

Optimized approach:
  - Specialized Date Range Orchestrator
  - Single multi-day aggregation query
  - Post-processing for daily breakdown
  - Tokens: ~2,800 | Duration: ~3.5s

Applying optimization...
```

The orchestrator generates:
```sql
SELECT CAST(SaleDate AS DATE) as Day,
       SUM(TotalAmount) as DailySales
FROM fitness_db.Sales
WHERE SaleDate >= CURRENT_DATE - 7
GROUP BY CAST(SaleDate AS DATE)
ORDER BY Day
```

One query. Seven days. Clean results.

Tokens: 2,800 (9,200 saved vs naive approach)
Duration: 3.2s (11.8s saved)

Other specialized orchestrators:

**Comparative Analysis Orchestrator:**
Query: "Compare Claude vs GPT-4 on this question: [complex query]"

Detects: Multi-model comparison pattern
Optimization: Executes query on both models in parallel, aggregates results
Savings: ~40% faster than sequential execution

**Multi-Table Join Orchestrator:**  
Query: "Join customers, sales, and products for full order analysis"

Detects: Complex multi-table join pattern
Optimization: Single optimized JOIN query instead of multiple tool calls
Savings: ~60% token reduction

**TECHNIQUE 4: CONTEXT DISTILLATION**

Ask: "List all products in the database."

The query returns 500 products. That's a lot of data.

Now ask a follow-up: "Which of those are Cardio equipment?"

Normally, the agent would send all 500 product records back to the LLM for analysis. 
That's ~50,000 tokens of context.

Watch the optimization:

```
💧 OPTIMIZATION: CONTEXT DISTILLATION

Previous tool result: 500 products (48,000 tokens raw)
New query requires: Subset filtering by ProductType='Cardio'

Strategy: DISTILL large dataset before LLM processing
  - Apply deterministic filter: ProductType='Cardio'
  - Reduced dataset: 87 products
  - Context tokens: 48,000 → 4,200 (91% reduction)

Passing distilled context to LLM for response generation...
```

The agent performed a deterministic pre-filter, dramatically reducing context size 
before involving the LLM.

Tokens used: 5,800 total (42,200 saved)
Cost: $0.028 ($2.10 saved on this single query)

Context distillation applies when:
- Large tool results (>10,000 tokens)
- Follow-up query requires subset or aggregation
- Deterministic filtering possible without LLM reasoning

**TECHNIQUE 5: MULTI-TOOL PARALLEL EXECUTION**

Ask: "Give me the database version, table list, and current system date."

The agent detects three independent requests:

```
⚡ OPTIMIZATION: PARALLEL TOOL EXECUTION

Query decomposition:
  1. Database version → dba_databaseVersion (independent)
  2. Table list → base_tableList (independent)
  3. Current date → TDA_CurrentDate (independent)

No dependencies detected. Executing in parallel...

Parallel execution:
  [Thread 1] dba_databaseVersion → 0.8s
  [Thread 2] base_tableList → 1.2s
  [Thread 3] TDA_CurrentDate → 0.1s
  
  Total duration: 1.2s (longest thread)
  
Sequential execution would take: 2.1s
Time saved: 0.9s (43% faster)
```

When multiple tools have no data dependencies, the Fusion Optimizer executes them 
concurrently.

Average daily: $1.14
Projected monthly: $35.04
```

This helps with budgeting and cost forecasting.

**PROVIDER COST COMPARISON:**

Now here's where it gets strategic. Go to Intelligence → Provider Comparison.

You can run the same workload on different models and see actual cost differences:

```
WORKLOAD: "Standard Revenue Analysis" (10 typical queries)

┌─────────────────────────┬──────────┬─────────┬──────────┐
│ Provider/Model          │ Tokens   │ Cost    │ Duration │
├─────────────────────────┼──────────┼─────────┼──────────┤
│ Claude Opus             │ 24,500   │ $0.487  │ 8.2s     │
│ Claude Sonnet 3.5       │ 24,500   │ $0.097  │ 7.8s     │
│ GPT-4o                  │ 26,100   │ $0.131  │ 9.1s     │

Recommendation: Use Gemini Flash for routine queries (@COST profile),
                Claude Sonnet for complex analysis (@PROD profile),
                Ollama for sensitive data (@LOCAL profile)
```

This data-driven comparison helps you optimize your profile strategy.

**RAG EFFICIENCY SAVINGS:**

Back to Intelligence → RAG Efficiency.

The RAG system tracks how much it saves you:

```
RAG COST IMPACT ANALYSIS:

Total queries: 247
RAG-guided queries: 183 (74%)

Without RAG (projected baseline):
  Average tokens per query: 3,612
  Total tokens: 892,164
  Total cost: $52.30

With RAG (actual usage):
  Average tokens per query: 2,611  
  Total tokens: 645,013
  Total cost: $37.60

RAG SAVINGS:
  Tokens saved: 247,151 (28%)
  Cost saved: $14.70 (28%)
  
Cost per query:
  Without RAG: $0.212
  With RAG: $0.152
  Savings per query: $0.060

Projected annual savings (at current usage): $876
```

The RAG system pays for itself through continuous optimization.

**OPTIMIZATION INSIGHTS:**

Every cost display includes optimization context:

```
💡 COST OPTIMIZATION TIPS:

1. Turn 7 used Claude Opus ($0.0456) for a simple lookup.
   → Could use Gemini Flash ($0.0018) for 96% cost reduction
   
2. 34% of queries are suitable for fast-path execution.
   → Enable tactical fast path for ~$12/month savings
   
3. Session "Daily Reports" runs at peak hours with Sonnet.
   → Switch to Gemini Flash off-peak for 90% cost reduction
   
4. 12 queries loaded >10K context unnecessarily.
   → Enable context distillation for ~$8/month savings
```

Actionable recommendations based on your actual usage patterns.

**COST ALERTS:**

You can set spending alerts:

```
🚨 COST ALERT CONFIGURATION:

✓ Daily spending exceeds $5
✓ Session cost exceeds $1  
✓ Single query exceeds $0.50
✓ Monthly projected spend exceeds $150

Alert method: Email + Dashboard notification
```

If a query unexpectedly balloons in cost, you'll know immediately.

## Module 5: SOVEREIGNTY - Your Data, Your Rules
**Goal:** Demonstrate ultimate flexibility in data exposure and infrastructure choice

### 5.1 Multi-Provider LLM Support: Freedom to Choose
**Duration:** 3-4 minutes  
**Learning Objectives:**
- Explore supported LLM providers
- Learn provider switching mechanics
- Understand use cases for different providers

**Key Topics to Cover:**
- [ ] Cloud hyperscalers (Google, Anthropic, OpenAI, Azure)
- [ ] AWS Bedrock support
- [ ] Friendli.AI integration
- [ ] Ollama for local execution
- [ ] Dynamic provider switching
- [ ] Live model refresh

**Narration Script:**
```
Most AI platforms lock you into one provider. Choose Claude or GPT-4 or Gemini—you're stuck.

Vendor lock-in. No flexibility. No negotiating leverage.

Uderia breaks this constraint. True multi-provider freedom.

**THE PROVIDER LANDSCAPE:**

Setup → LLM Providers. Uderia's ecosystem:

```
PROVIDER ECOSYSTEM:

☁️ Cloud Hyperscalers:
   • Anthropic (Claude Opus, Sonnet, Haiku)
   • OpenAI (GPT-4o, GPT-4o-mini)
   • Google (Gemini 1.5 Pro, Flash)
   • Azure OpenAI (Enterprise models)

🔧 Managed Inference:
   • AWS Bedrock (foundation models + inference profiles)
   • Friendli.AI (optimized inference)

🏠 Sovereign Execution:
   • Ollama (Llama 3.1, Mistral, Qwen - fully local)
```

Every provider. Every model. One platform. Your choice.

**ADDING A NEW PROVIDER:**

Add AWS Bedrock. Click "Add Provider" → "AWS Bedrock."

```
BEDROCK CONFIGURATION:

🌍 Region: us-east-1
🔑 Access Key ID: [encrypted at rest]
🔐 Secret Access Key: [SHA256 hashing + salt]
⚡ Inference Profile: [optional cross-region routing]

Save → Bedrock available
```

**MODEL SELECTION:**

Setup → Profiles → Edit @PROD.

LLM Provider dropdown:

```
AVAILABLE PROVIDERS:
• Claude Sonnet 3.5 (Anthropic)
• GPT-4o (OpenAI)
• Gemini 1.5 Pro (Google)
• Claude Sonnet 3.5 v2 (AWS Bedrock)
• Llama 3.1 70B (Ollama - Local)
```

One dropdown. Six infrastructure options.

Select "Claude Sonnet 3.5 v2 (AWS Bedrock)" → Save.
**DYNAMIC PROVIDER SWITCHING:**

Flexibility in action. Query with @PROD (AWS Bedrock):

```
QUERY: "Q4 revenue trends by product category?"

@PROD Execution:
├─ Provider: AWS Bedrock
├─ Model: Claude Sonnet 3.5 v2
├─ Region: us-east-1
└─ Cost: $0.0112
```

Switch to @ANALYST (Google Gemini Flash). Same query:

```
@ANALYST Execution:
├─ Provider: Google AI
├─ Model: Gemini 1.5 Flash
└─ Cost: $0.0018 (6x cheaper)
```

Same question. Different provider. Different cost.

You're not locked in. You're orchestrating strategically.
Execution:
- Provider: Google AI
- Model: Gemini 1.5 Flash
- Cost: $0.0018

Same question. Same Uderia platform. Different provider. Different cost. Different 
infrastructure characteristics (Gemini is 6x cheaper, but less capable on complex reasoning).

You're not locked in. You're orchestrating providers strategically.

**USE CASES FOR DIFFERENT PROVIDERS:**

```
STRATEGIC PROVIDER SELECTION:

Anthropic Direct → Latest Claude features, fastest updates
AWS Bedrock → Enterprise compliance, cross-region routing
Google AI → Cost optimization, fast inference, multimodal
OpenAI → GPT-4 reasoning, specific requirements
Ollama Local → Complete sovereignty, zero cloud cost
```

**LIVE MODEL REFRESH:**

Providers release new models constantly. Uderia supports live refresh.

Setup → LLM Providers → "Refresh Models."

Uderia queries the provider API. Updates dropdown immediately.

No platform restart. No config editing. Just click.

Anthropic released Claude Opus 4? Refresh → Available.
OpenAI released GPT-5? Refresh → Ready.
**COST ARBITRAGE:**

Strategic advantage: price competition between providers.

```
PRICING COMPARISON (per 1M tokens):

Model                        Input / Output
─────────────────────────────────────────────
Claude Sonnet 3.5 (Anthropic)  $3 / $15
Claude Sonnet 3.5 v2 (Bedrock) $3 / $15 (volume discounts)
Gemini 1.5 Pro (Google)        $1.25 / $5 (comparable quality)
```

Test identical queries across providers. Measure quality. Choose optimal cost-to-quality ratios.
**PROVIDER FAILOVER:**

Bonus: provider outage? Switch profiles and continue.

Anthropic API down? Switch @PROD (Anthropic) → @BACKUP (AWS Bedrock Claude).

Same model. Different infrastructure. Zero downtime.

Multi-provider sovereignty. Not vendor lock-in. Not single-point-of-failure.

From "stuck with one vendor" to "orchestrating the entire AI ecosystem."

Your data. Your infrastructure. Your choice.

### 5.2 Hybrid Intelligence: Cloud Power + Local Privacy
**Duration:** 4-5 minutes  
**Learning Objectives:**
- Understand hybrid architecture
- See cloud planning + local execution
- Learn champion case injection for local models

**Key Topics to Cover:**
- [ ] Hybrid architecture concept (strategic planner vs executor)
- [ ] Cloud LLM for planning intelligence
- [ ] Local Ollama for private execution
- [ ] Champion case injection to boost local model performance
- [ ] Complete data sovereignty

**Narration Script:**
```
The impossible choice every organization faces: cloud intelligence or data sovereignty.

Pick one.

Uderia says: Why not both?

Hybrid Intelligence—cloud reasoning with zero-trust privacy.

**THE IMPOSSIBLE CHOICE:**

```
TRADITIONAL APPROACH:

Option A: Cloud Models (Claude, GPT-4)
├─ Intelligence: ✓✓ Brilliant
├─ Data: ✗ Sent to external APIs
└─ Sovereignty: ✗ Sacrificed

Option B: Local Models (Ollama)
├─ Intelligence: ✗ Mediocre
├─ Data: ✓ Kept private
└─ Sovereignty: ✓ Maintained
```

Binary choice. Intelligence OR privacy. Never both.

**UDERIA'S HYBRID ARCHITECTURE:**

Uderia splits the AI agent into two layers:

```
LAYER 1: Strategic Planner (Cloud)
├─ Runs: Claude, GPT-4, Gemini
├─ Receives: Question + tool names + schemas
├─ Does NOT receive: Actual data, PII, results
├─ Generates: Strategic plan, SQL templates
└─ Sends: Intelligence back to your infrastructure

LAYER 2: Tactical Executor (Local/Sovereign)
├─ Runs: Ollama on YOUR infrastructure
├─ Receives: Strategic plan + MCP tools + actual data
├─ Executes: SQL against YOUR database
├─ Data: Never leaves your environment
└─ Returns: Results to you (never to cloud)
```

Cloud does the thinking. Local does the data access.

**DEMONSTRATION: @LOCAL PROFILE WITH HYBRID MODE**

Switch to @LOCAL profile.

```
PROFILE CONFIGURATION:

Strategic Planner: Claude Sonnet 3.5 (Cloud - Anthropic)
Tactical Executor: Llama 3.1 70B (Local - Ollama)
MCP Tools: Local Teradata connector
Mode: Hybrid Intelligence
```
**SCENARIO: Analyzing Customer Churn with PII**

Ask: "Identify customers who stopped purchasing in Q4, show their names, emails, addresses, and analyze common patterns for churn risk."

This requires:
- Sensitive PII (names, emails, addresses)
- Multi-table joins (Customers, Sales)
- Complex pattern analysis

Live Status Panel shows:
- Sensitive PII (names, emails, addresses)
- Multi-table joins (Customers, Sales)
- Complex pattern analysis (churn indicators)

Watch what happens in the Live Status Panel:

```
🌩️ STRATEGIC PLANNING (Cloud - Claude Sonnet 3.5):

Query received: "Identify customers who stopped purchasing in Q4..."

Data sent to cloud: 
  - Query text: ✓
  - Available tools: [base_readQuery, base_tableList, TDA_LLMTask]
  - Schema info: Customers(CustomerID, FirstName, LastName, Email, Address...)
                Sales(SaleID, CustomerID, SaleDate...)
  - Actual customer data: ✗ (NEVER SENT)

Strategic Plan Generated:
  Phase 1: Query customers with no Q4 purchases
    Tool: base_readQuery
    SQL Template: SELECT c.CustomerID, c.FirstName, c.LastName, c.Email, c.Address
                  FROM Customers c 
                  LEFT JOIN Sales s ON c.CustomerID = s.CustomerID 
                    AND EXTRACT(QUARTER FROM s.SaleDate) = 4
                  WHERE s.SaleID IS NULL
  
  Phase 2: Analyze patterns using TDA_LLMTask
    Input: Churned customer demographics
    Analysis: Identify common characteristics

Plan sent back to local environment.
```

```
CLOUD RECEIVED:
✓ Your question (not sensitive)
✓ Schema metadata (table/column names)
✓ Tool names (generic capabilities)

CLOUD NEVER RECEIVED:
✗ Customer names, emails, addresses
✗ Actual sales data
✗ Any PII or confidential information
```

Cloud generated brilliant strategic plan without ever touching your data.

```
🏠 TACTICAL EXECUTION (Local - Ollama Llama 3.1 70B):

Strategic plan received from cloud.
Executing locally with full data access...

Phase 1 Execution:
  Tool: base_readQuery (LOCAL MCP connector)
  SQL: [Executing against local Teradata database]
  Results: 47 customers identified
  
  Sample data (STAYS LOCAL):
    - John Smith, john.smith@email.com, 123 Main St, Boston MA
    - Sarah Johnson, sarah.j@email.com, 456 Oak Ave, Seattle WA
    [...45 more customers with full PII]

Phase 2 Execution:
  Tool: TDA_LLMTask (LOCAL Ollama execution)
  Input: Churned customer demographics
  Analysis: 
    - 68% are located in urban areas
    - Average age: 34-42 demographic
    - Common trait: High service ticket volume (avg 3.2 tickets per customer)
    - Purchase pattern: Previously bought Cardio equipment
  
  Churn indicator: Strong correlation with unresolved service issues

Final Report Generated (LOCAL):
  Churn risk strongly tied to poor customer service experience.
  Recommendation: Proactive outreach to customers with >2 open service tickets.
```

```
DATA FLOW:
1. Your question → Cloud (strategic planning)
2. Strategic plan ← Cloud (execution strategy)
3. Data access → Local only (PII never leaves)
4. Analysis → Local Ollama (cloud strategy)
5. Results → You (privacy maintained)

THE RESULT:
✓ Cloud-level strategic intelligence
✓ Complete data sovereignty
✓ Regulatory compliance (GDPR, HIPAA, SOC2)
✓ Zero compromise on capability
```

**PERFORMANCE COMPARISON:**

```
APPROACH COMPARISON:

Approach 1: Fully Cloud (Traditional)
├─ Quality: 95/100 (excellent)
├─ Privacy: ✗ (PII exposed to third party)
├─ Compliance: ✗ (violates data residency)
└─ Cost: $0.045

Approach 2: Fully Local (Traditional)
├─ Quality: 72/100 (struggles with planning)
├─ Privacy: ✓ (completely local)
├─ Compliance: ✓ (data never leaves)
└─ Cost: $0.00 (local execution)

Approach 3: Uderia Hybrid Intelligence
├─ Quality: 92/100 (cloud strategy + local execution)
├─ Privacy: ✓ (data never leaves premises)
├─ Compliance: ✓ (regulatory requirements met)
└─ Cost: $0.012 (planning only, execution free)
```

92% of full-cloud quality with 100% data sovereignty. Best of both worlds.

**CHAMPION CASE INJECTION BOOST:**

Here's the multiplier effect. Remember RAG champion cases from Module 4.2?
**CHAMPION CASE INJECTION BOOST:**

Multiplier effect. RAG champion cases from Module 4.2?

Hybrid Intelligence with @LOCAL: local Ollama gets boosted by champion cases learned from cloud.

```
LEARNING SEQUENCE:
1. Cloud Claude generates brilliant plan
2. RAG captures as champion case
3. Next similar query: Cloud plan + RAG champion
4. Local Ollama receives: Strategy + past success
5. Result: Local performs at near-cloud quality
```

Local model isn't just executing. It's learning from cloud intelligence via RAG—without exposing your data.

**THE BREAKTHROUGH:**

```
COMPARISON MATRIX:

                    Intelligence  Privacy    Cost
Traditional Cloud      ✓✓          ✗        $$$
Traditional Local      ✗           ✓✓        $
Uderia Hybrid          ✓✓          ✓✓       $$
```

From impossible choice to having it all.

Cloud-level reasoning. Zero-trust privacy. No compromise.

Your data stays home. Your intelligence reaches the cloud. Hybrid sovereignty.

### 5.3 Security & Multi-User Isolation
**Duration:** 3-4 minutes  
**Learning Objectives:**
- Understand JWT authentication
- Learn user isolation mechanisms
- Explore role-based access control

**Key Topics to Cover:**
- [ ] JWT-based authentication (24-hour expiry)
- [ ] User-specific session directories
- [ ] Database-level UUID isolation
- [ ] Role-based access (User, Developer, Admin)
- [ ] Encrypted credential storage
- [ ] Multi-user simultaneous support

**Narration Script:**
```
Data sovereignty isn't just where your data lives. It's who can access it.

Uderia: bank-grade security isolation for enterprise multi-user environments.

**JWT AUTHENTICATION: SHORT-LIVED TOKENS**

Login to Uderia? Not a permanent session cookie. JSON Web Token (JWT) with 24-hour expiration.

```
LOGIN SEQUENCE:
1. Enter username + password
2. Server validates (bcrypt-hashed, salted)
3. Server issues JWT (HS256 signed)
4. Token contains: user_id, username, role, expiration
5. Stored: httpOnly cookie (secure)

EVERY API REQUEST:
✓ Signature authentic?
✓ Not expired?
✓ Valid account status?

After 24 hours → Token expires → Re-authenticate
```

Security by design. Stolen token? Worthless after 24 hours.

**USER-SPECIFIC SESSION ISOLATION:**

Multi-user isolation. File system level.

```
SESSION DIRECTORIES:

tda_sessions/
├── user_alice_82b9231b.../
│   ├── session_001.json
│   └── session_002.json
├── user_bob_f3a1c5d7.../
│   └── session_001.json
└── user_carol_a9b8c7d6.../
    └── session_001.json
```

UUID suffix? Security isolation.

**Alice cannot access Bob's sessions.** File system enforces user-specific paths.

```
API REQUEST: GET /api/sessions/user_bob_session_001
JWT TOKEN: user_id=alice
SERVER: 403 Forbidden (user_id mismatch)
```

Session data isolated: file system level AND application level.

**DATABASE-LEVEL UUID ISOLATION:**
**DATABASE-LEVEL UUID ISOLATION:**

Database layer: PostgreSQL with UUID-based user identification.

Not sequential integers. UUIDs. Non-enumerable.

```
BAD (Sequential IDs):
SELECT * FROM consumption_logs WHERE user_id = 1001;
Attacker: "Try 1002, 1003, 1004..." (enumeration attack)

GOOD (UUID):
SELECT * FROM consumption_logs 
WHERE user_id = '82b9231b-08b1-4b1e-bcdf-9762db21f90b';
Attacker: "Try... um... 82b9231b...90c?" (impossible)
```

Every table uses UUID foreign keys:

```
users(user_id UUID)
sessions(session_id UUID, user_id UUID)
consumption_logs(log_id UUID, user_id UUID)
rag_cases(case_id UUID, user_id UUID)
```

Even with SQL injection (doesn't exist—parameterized queries), enumerating users is cryptographically infeasible.
**ROLE-BASED ACCESS CONTROL (RBAC):**

**ROLE-BASED ACCESS CONTROL (RBAC):**

Three roles with escalating privileges:

```
ROLE: User (Standard)
├─ Execute queries (UI + API)
├─ Manage own sessions
├─ Access own RAG collections
└─ View own consumption logs

ROLE: Developer
├─ All User permissions +
├─ Developer tools
├─ Custom MCP servers
└─ Debug mode + advanced logging

ROLE: Admin
├─ All Developer permissions +
├─ User management (create, delete, suspend)
├─ System configuration (LLM providers, MCP)
├─ Global consumption analytics
├─ Long-lived access tokens
└─ Audit log access
```

Role enforcement at every API endpoint:

```python
@app.route('/api/admin/users', methods=['GET'])
@require_role('Admin')
def list_all_users():
    # Only executes if JWT has role='Admin'
    return get_all_users()
```

Access admin endpoints without admin role? **403 Forbidden.**

When you configure LLM providers (Anthropic API keys, AWS credentials, etc.), where 
do those secrets go?

NOT in plaintext. Not in environment variables (easily leaked). In encrypted database columns.

Storage sequence:
1. User enters API key: `sk-ant-api03-xxxxxxxxxxxx`
2. Server encrypts with AES-256: `U2FsdGVkX1+abcdef...` (cipher text)
3. Server stores cipher text in database
4. When needed: Server decrypts on-the-fly for API calls
5. Cipher text never leaves the server

Even if someone dumps the database, they get encrypted gibberish—useless without the 
encryption key (stored separately in secure environment variables).

This is how Uderia handles sensitive credentials:
- LLM provider API keys: Encrypted
- AWS access keys: Encrypted
- Database connection strings: Encrypted
- OAuth tokens: Encrypted

**MULTI-USER SIMULTANEOUS SUPPORT:**

Shared multi-user platform. Alice, Bob, Carol—all logged in simultaneously. No interference.

How?

```
SESSION ISOLATION:
Alice: tda_sessions/user_alice_.../session_001.json
Bob: tda_sessions/user_bob_.../session_001.json
No overlap. No cross-contamination.

MEMORY ISOLATION:
• Python processes handle requests independently
• No shared state between users
• Each API call validates JWT + user_id

DATABASE ISOLATION:
• All queries filtered by user_id UUID
• PostgreSQL row-level security policies
• Application layer blocks cross-user queries
```

**AUDIT LOGGING:**

Compliance and security monitoring. Audit logs:

```
AUDIT LOG ENTRIES:

[10:32:15] alice (82b9...) | LOGIN | IP: 192.168.1.45 | Success
[10:33:01] alice (82b9...) | QUERY_EXECUTE | session_001 | $0.0045
[10:45:22] bob (f3a1...) | LOGIN | IP: 192.168.1.67 | Success
[10:46:10] bob (f3a1...) | ACCESS_ADMIN_PANEL | DENIED (role=User)
[11:02:33] admin (a9b8...) | USER_CREATE | Target: carol | Role: User
```

Every sensitive action logged. Admins review:

```
✓ Failed login attempts (brute force detection)
✓ Unauthorized access attempts (security monitoring)
✓ User creation/deletion (accountability)
✓ Credential changes (suspicious activity)
```
**THE SECURITY GUARANTEE:**

```
UDERIA MULTI-USER ARCHITECTURE:

Authentication → JWT (24h expiration) + bcrypt hashing
Isolation → User-specific paths + UUID database keys
Authorization → RBAC (User, Developer, Admin)
Encryption → AES-256 (credentials) + SHA256 (tokens)
Auditability → Complete logging (compliance + forensics)
```

From "shared platform" to "bank-grade multi-tenant security."

Your data. Your users. Your control. Complete isolation. Total security.

## Module 6: COLLABORATIVE - Intelligence Marketplace
**Goal:** Transform individual expertise into collective organizational knowledge

### 6.1 Marketplace Overview: Collective Intelligence
**Duration:** 3-4 minutes  
**Learning Objectives:**
- Understand marketplace value proposition
- Learn dual repository architecture (Planner vs Knowledge)
- See community ecosystem vision

**Key Topics to Cover:**
- [ ] From isolated expertise to collective intelligence
- [ ] Planner Repositories (📋 execution patterns)
- [ ] Knowledge Repositories (📄 domain knowledge)
- [ ] Visual separation and organization
- [ ] Network effects and cost reduction

**Narration Script:**
```
Every organization faces the same problem.

Your data analyst discovers a brilliant query pattern for customer churn analysis. Three days of iteration. $45 in LLM tokens. Perfect results.

Next week, another analyst asks the same question. Starts from zero. Another three days. Another $45.

Reinventing the wheel.

Uderia's Marketplace breaks this cycle. Collective Intelligence—organizational knowledge becomes reusable assets.

**THE MARKETPLACE VISION:**

Marketplace icon → Uderia's dual repository architecture:

```
TWO TYPES OF INTELLIGENCE:

📋 PLANNER REPOSITORIES (Left Tab):
   • Execution patterns ("how to do it")
   • RAG champion cases from successful queries
   • Strategic plans, tool sequences, optimizations
   • Think: "Recipes for accomplishing tasks"
   
   Examples:
   ├─ Customer Churn Analysis Patterns (23 cases)
   ├─ Revenue Forecasting Templates (17 cases)
   └─ Database Performance Playbooks (31 cases)

📄 KNOWLEDGE REPOSITORIES (Right Tab):
   • Domain expertise ("what you need to know")
   • Uploaded documents: Specs, guides, documentation
   • Chunked and embedded for RAG retrieval
   • Think: "Reference library your AI can read"
   
   Examples:
   ├─ GDPR Compliance Guidelines (47 chunks)
   ├─ SQL Optimization Best Practices (89 chunks)
   └─ Teradata System Documentation (312 chunks)
```

```

Sort by: Most Popular | Top Rated | Recently Added | Most Relevant
**THE VALUE PROPOSITION:**

Quantifying collective intelligence:

```
WITHOUT MARKETPLACE (Traditional):
Analyst A → Develops churn query → 3 days, $45
Analyst B → Same need, starts from scratch → 3 days, $45
Analyst C → Same need, starts from scratch → 3 days, $45
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Total: 9 days, $135, 3x redundant work

WITH MARKETPLACE (Uderia):
Analyst A → Develops query → 3 days, $45 → Publishes
Analyst B → Searches → Finds pattern → Deploys → 5 min, $0.12
Analyst C → Same search → Same deploy → 5 min, $0.12
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Total: 3 days + 10 min, $45.24 (67% savings), zero redundancy
```

Analyst A's effort → Organizational asset. B and C benefit immediately.ce
- Analyst B: Searches marketplace → Finds "Customer Churn Patterns" → Deploys to profile → 5 minutes, $0.12 cost
- Analyst C: Same search → Same deployment → 5 minutes, $0.12 cost

**Total:** 3 days + 10 minutes, $45.24 cost (67% savings), zero redundancy

Analyst A's effort becomes organizational asset. Analysts B and C benefit immediately.

**NETWORK EFFECTS:**

The more people contribute, the more valuable the marketplace:

```
MARKETPLACE GROWTH:

After 10 analysts:
├─ 10 planner collections (200+ champion cases)
├─ 10 knowledge collections (500+ document chunks)
└─ Every new analyst → Instant collective expertise

After 100 users:
├─ 100+ collections (every common business question)
├─ Thousands of validated patterns
├─ New analysts productive on day one
└─ Zero ramp-up time for standard analyses
```

Value grows exponentially. Classic network effect.

**COST REDUCTION AT SCALE:**

Marketplace impact projection:

```
ORGANIZATION: 50 analysts

WITHOUT MARKETPLACE:
• Each analyst: 10 common queries/quarter
• Avg cost per query: $30 (LLM tokens + time)
• Total quarterly: 50 × 10 × $30 = $15,000
• Redundancy rate: ~70% (already solved elsewhere)

WITH MARKETPLACE:
• 30% developed from scratch: $4,500
• 70% reused from marketplace: $210 (deploy only)
• Total quarterly: $4,710
• Savings: $10,290 (69% reduction)
```

**DISCOVERY & SEARCH:**

Finding the right collection? Smart search.

### 6.3 Knowledge Repositories: Share Domain Expertise
**Duration:** 3-4 minutes  
**Learning Objectives:**
- Upload documents to knowledge collections
- Publish knowledge for community access
- Deploy knowledge to your environment

**Key Topics to Cover:**
- [ ] Creating knowledge collections
- [ ] Document upload (PDF, TXT, DOCX, MD)
- [ ] Chunking strategies
- [ ] Publishing to marketplace
- [ ] Subscribing to expert knowledge

**Narration Script:**
```
Planner Repositories capture execution patterns—the "how to do it."

But what about domain expertise? Product specifications? Compliance regulations? Technical documentation?

Knowledge Repositories. The second pillar of Uderia's marketplace—shareable, searchable, AI-readable domain knowledge.

**WHAT ARE KNOWLEDGE REPOSITORIES?**

Collections of uploaded documents—chunked, embedded, indexed for RAG retrieval. Your AI agents search them, reference them, answer questions using expert knowledge.

```
THINK OF THEM AS:
• Reference libraries your AI reads instantly
• Institutional memory that never forgets
• Expert knowledge accessible to every user

DIFFERENCE FROM PLANNER REPOSITORIES:
Planners → Execution patterns ("how to analyze churn")
Knowledge → Domain facts ("what is churn, why, benchmarks")
```

Different architecture. Different purpose. Both essential.

**CREATING A KNOWLEDGE COLLECTION:**

Marketplace → Knowledge Repositories → "Create Collection."

```
COLLECTION SETUP:

Name: "Fitness Equipment Product Catalog"

Description: "Complete product specifications, pricing history, 
warranty terms, technical details for all fitness equipment."

Category: Product Knowledge
Tags: #products #specifications #warranty #pricing

Visibility:
○ Public (all users in org)
○ Unlisted (link only)
○ Private (only you)
```

Choose **Public**—benefits entire sales and support team.

Click "Create Collection." Empty collection ready for documents.

**DOCUMENT UPLOAD:**
**DOCUMENT UPLOAD:**

Click "Upload Documents."

```
SUPPORTED FORMATS:
PDF | TXT | DOCX | MD | CSV (experimental)

YOUR DOCUMENTS:
1. product_catalog_2024.pdf (47 pages, product specs)
2. warranty_policies.docx (12 pages, terms)
3. pricing_history_q4.txt (pricing changes)

VALIDATION:
✓ product_catalog_2024.pdf (2.3 MB, 47 pages)
✓ warranty_policies.docx (487 KB, 12 pages)
✓ pricing_history_q4.txt (23 KB, plain text)
```

All accepted. Click "Process Documents."
**CHUNKING CONFIGURATION:**

Before AI-searchable, documents need chunking—split large documents into smaller, semantically meaningful pieces.

Why?
- LLMs have context limits (can't ingest 47-page PDF in one shot)
- Retrieval precision improves (find exact paragraph, not entire document)
- Embedding efficiency (smaller chunks = better semantic matching)

```
CHUNKING STRATEGIES:

1. Fixed Size (Default)
   Size: 1000 chars | Overlap: 200 chars
   Best for: General documents, mixed content

2. Semantic Paragraphs
   Size: ~800 chars (variable) | By paragraph boundaries
   Best for: Well-structured documents

3. Hybrid (Recommended)
   Semantic paragraphs + max 1200 char limit | Overlap: 150
   Best for: Mixed documents
```

Choose **Hybrid**. Click "Start Chunking."

**PROCESSING STATUS:**

**USING DEPLOYED KNOWLEDGE:**

Let's test it. Ask:

"What's the best approach for indexing a table with 500 million rows?"

Watch the RAG retrieval:

```
📚 KNOWLEDGE RETRIEVAL:

Searching knowledge repositories for relevant information...

Matches found:

1. SQL Optimization Best Practices → Chunk #34 (Similarity: 0.91)
   "For tables exceeding 100 million rows, consider partitioned primary indexes (PPI) 
   rather than non-partitioned. PPIs enable partition elimination, drastically reducing 
   I/O for time-series queries. Choose partition column based on most common query filters..."

2. SQL Optimization Best Practices → Chunk #22 (Similarity: 0.87)
   "Index design for very large tables requires balancing insert performance with query 
   speed. Consider: (1) Fewer indexes = faster inserts, (2) Covering indexes for common 
   queries, (3) Index compression for space efficiency..."

3. SQL Optimization Best Practices → Chunk #48 (Similarity: 0.82)
   "Common mistake: Over-indexing large tables. Each index adds overhead to INSERT/UPDATE 
   operations. Aim for 3-5 strategic indexes rather than 15+ reactive indexes..."

Injecting top 3 chunks into context...
```

The LLM receives:
- Your question
- Three expert knowledge chunks (PPI strategy, design tradeoffs, common mistakes)
- No generic advice—actual Teradata-specific expertise

Execution:
```
Based on the SQL Optimization Best Practices knowledge repository:

For a 500M row table, I recommend:

1. **Primary Index Strategy:**
   Use Partitioned Primary Index (PPI) rather than traditional NUPI. This enables 
   partition elimination for time-series queries, reducing I/O by 90%+.
   
   Choose partition column based on your most common filter (e.g., SaleDate for sales data).

2. **Secondary Indexes (Limit to 3-5 strategic indexes):**
   - Covering index for most frequent query pattern
   - Index on foreign key columns for join optimization
   - Consider compressed indexes to save space

3. **Avoid Over-Indexing:**
   Each index adds 15-20% overhead to INSERT operations. With 500M rows, this compounds 
   significantly. Focus on high-impact indexes only.

4. **Statistics Collection:**
   Run COLLECT STATISTICS on indexed columns monthly. Without stats, optimizer makes 
   poor decisions regardless of index quality.

Would you like me to generate the DDL for a PPI table with recommended indexes?
```

This isn't generic AI advice. This is expert DBA knowledge, retrieved from the deployed 
collection, applied to your specific question.

**THE KNOWLEDGE MULTIPLICATION:**

```
WITHOUT KNOWLEDGE REPOSITORY:
├─ Junior DBA asks indexing question
├─ AI gives generic advice ("add indexes on queried columns")
├─ Quality: 5/10 (not wrong, not expert)
└─ Implements mediocre solution

WITH KNOWLEDGE REPOSITORY:
├─ Junior DBA asks same question
├─ RAG retrieves expert DBA knowledge chunks
├─ AI gives Teradata-specific, battle-tested advice
├─ Quality: 9/10 (expert-level, first try)
└─ Implements optimal solution
```

**ROI OF KNOWLEDGE REPOSITORIES:**

```
TRADITIONAL APPROACH:
├─ Expert DBA: 10 years learning optimization
├─ Knowledge resides in expert's head
├─ Junior DBAs ask repeatedly (bottleneck)
└─ Expert leaves → Knowledge lost

KNOWLEDGE REPOSITORY APPROACH:
├─ Expert documents once (8 hours)
├─ Publishes to marketplace (89 chunks)
├─ 50 users deploy instantly
├─ Every user: 10 years expertise immediately
└─ Expert leaves → Knowledge persists
```

From knowledge locked in experts' heads to knowledge accessible to everyone, instantly, forever.

### 6.4 Subscribe, Fork, Rate: Community Ecosystem
**Duration:** 3-4 minutes  
**Learning Objectives:**
- Subscribe to collections (reference-based)
- Fork collections for customization
- Rate and review for quality assurance

**Key Topics to Cover:**
- [ ] Subscribe workflow (no data duplication)
- [ ] Fork workflow (independent copy)
- [ ] Rating system (1-5 stars)
- [ ] Publishing options (Public, Unlisted, Private)
- [ ] Community quality assurance

**Narration Script:**
```
Marketplaces don't work without ecosystems.

Consume content (Subscribe). Customize it (Fork). Ensure quality (Rate).

These three mechanisms transform Uderia's marketplace from "file dump" to "living, quality-assured community."

**SUBSCRIBE: REFERENCE-BASED DEPLOYMENT**

You discovered a great planner collection: "Customer Analytics Playbook" (45 patterns, 4.9⭐).

Click "Deploy to My Repository" → Choose **Subscribe** mode.

What happens?

**Technical Architecture:**
- Uderia creates a REFERENCE in your profile (not a copy)
- Your profile points to the original collection in the author's repository
- When you query, RAG searches both your patterns AND subscribed collections
- No data duplication—single source of truth

**Benefits of Subscribe:**

✓ **Auto-Updates:** Author adds new patterns? You get them immediately (no re-deployment)
✓ **Space Efficiency:** No storage duplication (one 45-pattern collection, infinite subscribers)
✓ **Quality Assurance:** Author improves a pattern? You benefit instantly
✓ **Author Attribution:** Usage stats flow back to author (recognition for contributions)

**Use Subscribe When:**
- You trust the author to maintain quality
- You want automatic updates
- The collection serves your needs as-is
- You're consuming standard organizational knowledge

**Example Workflow:**

Day 1: You subscribe to "Customer Analytics Playbook" (45 patterns)
Day 15: Author adds "Customer Lifetime Value Prediction" pattern (now 46 patterns)
Day 15 (30 seconds later): You automatically have access to new pattern. Zero action required.

This is live, continuous knowledge sharing.

**FORK: INDEPENDENT COPY**

"Sales Forecasting Templates" (23 patterns, 4.7⭐).

Good starting point. Customize for your industry? "Deploy to My Repository" → **Fork**.

```
TECHNICAL ARCHITECTURE:
├─ Uderia creates COMPLETE COPY in your repository
├─ Your fork is independent (no link to author)
├─ Modify, delete, add patterns freely
├─ Changes don't affect original
└─ Original updates don't propagate to fork

BENEFITS:
✓ Full Control (modify patterns to fit your needs)
✓ Experimentation (test changes without affecting others)
✓ Specialization (adapt for industry-specific requirements)
✓ Independence (no dependency on author)

USE FORK WHEN:
• Need to customize patterns heavily
• Adapting for specific industry/use case
• Want frozen version (no surprise updates)
• Plan to extend significantly
```

Example: Fork (23 patterns) → Delete 5 (fitness irrelevant) → Modify 10 (fitness_db tables) → Add 8 (seasonality forecasting) → "Fitness Industry Forecasting Playbook" (26 patterns, customized).

Original unchanged. Your fork tailored perfectly.

**SUBSCRIBE VS FORK DECISION MATRIX:**

| Scenario | Subscribe | Fork |
|----------|-----------|------|
| Standard organizational knowledge | ✓ | |
| Trust author to maintain quality | ✓ | |
| Want automatic updates | ✓ | |
| Need heavy customization | | ✓ |
| Industry-specific adaptation | | ✓ |
| Want frozen version | | ✓ |
| Experimental changes | | ✓ |
| Minimal storage duplication | ✓ | |

Think of it like software:
- **Subscribe** = Using npm package (linked, updates automatically)
- **Fork** = Copying code into your repo (independent, you control changes)

## Module 7: FINANCIAL GOVERNANCE
**Goal:** Complete transparency and control over LLM spending

### 7.1 Consumption Profiles & Rate Limiting
**Duration:** 3-4 minutes  
**Learning Objectives:**
- Understand consumption profile tiers
- Configure rate limits and quotas
- Monitor usage enforcement

**Key Topics to Cover:**
- [ ] Four profile tiers (Free, Pro, Enterprise, Unlimited)
- [ ] Per-user rate limits (hourly/daily prompts)
- [ ] Monthly token quotas
- [ ] Configuration change limits
- [ ] Admin bypass capabilities
- [ ] Real-time enforcement

**Narration Script:**
```
LLM costs spiral out of control fast.

One user runs 500 queries in a day experimenting. Another accidentally creates an infinite loop. A third trains a complex RAG case consuming $200 in tokens.

Without governance, your LLM bill becomes unpredictable.

Uderia solves this with Consumption Profiles—fine-grained rate limiting and quota management at the user level.

**THE FOUR CONSUMPTION TIERS:**

Admin → User Management → Consumption Profiles. Four tiers:

```
TIER 1: FREE (Evaluation Users)
├─ Hourly: 10 prompts
├─ Daily: 50 prompts
├─ Monthly: 100K tokens (~$0.15 ceiling)
├─ Config Changes: 3/day
└─ Use: Trial users, demos, proof-of-concept

TIER 2: PRO (Individual Contributors)
├─ Hourly: 30 prompts
├─ Daily: 200 prompts
├─ Monthly: 1M tokens (~$1.50 ceiling)
├─ Config Changes: 10/day
└─ Use: Analysts, developers, standard users

TIER 3: ENTERPRISE (Power Users)
├─ Hourly: 100 prompts
├─ Daily: 1,000 prompts
├─ Monthly: 10M tokens (~$15.00 ceiling)
├─ Config Changes: 50/day
└─ Use: Data scientists, DBAs, automation

TIER 4: UNLIMITED (Administrators & Production)
├─ Hourly: None
├─ Daily: None
├─ Monthly: None
├─ Config Changes: Unlimited
└─ Use: Admins, CI/CD, production API
```

Each tier balances access with cost control. Most start at PRO. Power users → ENTERPRISE. Admins → UNLIMITED.

**ASSIGNING CONSUMPTION PROFILES:**
**ASSIGNING CONSUMPTION PROFILES:**

Click user: alice@company.com

```
USER DETAILS:

Name: Alice Johnson
Role: User (standard permissions)
Current Profile: PRO (1M tokens/month)

Usage This Month:
├─ Tokens: 347,521 / 1,000,000 (34.8%)
├─ Prompts Today: 23 / 200 (11.5%)
└─ Status: ✓ Within limits
```

Alice operating normally. Needs more capacity for special project?

"Edit Profile" → Change to **ENTERPRISE** → Save.

Alice now has 10M tokens/month (10x increase), 1,000 prompts/day, 100 prompts/hour.

**RATE LIMIT ENFORCEMENT IN ACTION:**

Test user: bob@company.com with **FREE** profile (10/hour, 50/day).

Bob starts querying:

```
QUERY SEQUENCE:

Prompt 1: "Show me Q4 sales by region" ✓ (1/10)
Prompt 2: "Break down by product category" ✓ (2/10)
Prompt 3: "Add customer segmentation" ✓ (3/10)
...
Prompt 10: "Generate executive summary" ✓ (10/10)
Prompt 11: "Create visualization chart" ✗ RATE LIMITED
```

Bob hits hourly limit. Uderia responds:

```
⚠️ RATE LIMIT EXCEEDED

You have reached your hourly limit (10 prompts).

Profile: FREE | Next reset: 42 minutes

To increase limits, contact admin or upgrade to PRO 
(200 prompts/day, 1M tokens/month).
```

Bob can't query for 42 minutes. System enforces automatically. No manual policing.r 42 minutes. The system enforces limits automatically. No manual 
policing required.

**QUOTA EXHAUSTION:**

alice@company.com (PRO profile, 1M tokens/month) at month-end:

```
USAGE STATS:
Tokens Used: 987,432 / 1,000,000 (98.7%)
Remaining: 12,568 tokens (~19 prompts left)
```

Alice runs complex query:

```
QUERY VALIDATION:

Query: "Analyze 500K customer records, identify churn 
        patterns, generate report"

Estimated: 23,450 tokens
Available: 12,568 tokens
Result: ✗ INSUFFICIENT QUOTA
```

Uderia blocks:

```
⚠️ MONTHLY QUOTA EXCEEDED

This query requires 23,450 tokens.
You have 12,568 tokens remaining.

Profile: PRO (1M tokens/month)
Quota resets: December 1, 2025 (3 days)

Options:
1. Wait for reset (3 days)
2. Contact admin for quota increase
3. Simplify query to fit remaining tokens
```

Alice can't run expensive queries. Waits for reset or requests upgrade.

Financial governance in action—preventing runaway costs before they happen.

**CONFIGURATION CHANGE LIMITS:**

Subtle but important control. FREE profile: 3 configuration changes/day. Why?

```
SCENARIO WITHOUT LIMITS:
├─ User creates 10 profiles (different LLM providers)
├─ Switches between profiles 100 times/day
├─ Each switch triggers LLM calls for initialization
└─ Result: Excessive overhead, wasted tokens
```

Configuration limit prevents abuse. Bob (FREE) tries:

```
PROFILE SWITCHES:

Change 1: @ANALYST → @DBA ✓ (1/3)
Change 2: @DBA → @QUALITY ✓ (2/3)
Change 3: @QUALITY → @LOCAL ✓ (3/3)
Change 4: @LOCAL → @PROD ✗ BLOCKED
```

Limit reached:

```
⚠️ CONFIGURATION CHANGE LIMIT REACHED

You have made 3 profile switches today (FREE tier limit).

Next reset: 6 hours

Upgrade to PRO (10 changes/day) or ENTERPRISE (50 changes/day).
```

Can't profile-hop excessively. Prevents abuse and accidental overhead.
**ADMIN BYPASS & MONITORING:**

Admins have UNLIMITED profile by default:

```
ADMIN CAPABILITIES:
• No rate limits (query 1000 times/hour)
• No quota restrictions (unlimited tokens)
• No configuration limits (switch profiles freely)

WHY:
• Troubleshooting access (testing for users)
• Maintenance operations (bulk queries, validation)
• Emergency overrides (time-sensitive analysis)
```

Admins monitor global usage. Admin → Consumption Analytics:

```
GLOBAL USAGE SUMMARY:

Total Users: 127
Active This Month: 89 (70%)
Total Tokens: 34.2M tokens
Total Cost: $51.30
Avg Cost Per Active User: $0.58

USERS NEAR QUOTA (Top 5):
1. alice@company.com (PRO): 987K/1M (98.7%)
2. sarah@company.com (ENTERPRISE): 9.2M/10M (92%)
3. mike@company.com (PRO): 856K/1M (85.6%)

RATE LIMIT VIOLATIONS (Last 24h):
1. bob@company.com (FREE): 12 violations
2. carol@company.com (PRO): 3 violations
```

Admins can:
**EMERGENCY QUOTA OVERRIDE:**

Alice hits monthly quota but has urgent Q4 board presentation tomorrow.

Admin action:

```
EMERGENCY QUOTA GRANT:

1. User Management → alice@company.com
2. Click "Grant Emergency Quota"
3. Add: 500,000 tokens (temporary extension)
4. Expiration: 48 hours
5. Save
```

Alice now has:

```
QUOTA BREAKDOWN:
├─ Base Quota: 1M tokens (exhausted)
├─ Emergency Extension: +500K tokens (granted)
└─ Total Available: 500K tokens for 48 hours
```

After 48 hours → Emergency quota expires. Monthly reset → Replenishes base quota.

Controlled flexibility—governance with escape hatches for legitimate needs.

**ROI OF CONSUMPTION PROFILES:**

```
ORGANIZATION: 100 users, NO GOVERNANCE

10 power users × $50/month = $500
30 moderate users × $15/month = $450
60 light users × $3/month = $180

Consumption profiles don't just track costs. They eliminate runaway spending.

From "unpredictable bills" to "controlled, predictable LLM budgets."

From "after-the-fact shock" to "proactive governance."

Rate limits. Quotas. Visibility. Control. Financial governance.

### 7.2 Cost Analytics & Optimization
**Duration:** 4-5 minutes  
**Learning Objectives:**
- Analyze cost distribution by provider
- Identify most expensive models and queries
- Explore cost trends and optimization opportunities

**Key Topics to Cover:**
- [ ] Cost distribution by provider chart
- [ ] Top 5 most expensive models
- [ ] 30-day cost trend visualization
- [ ] Most expensive sessions/queries
- [ ] RAG efficiency savings metrics
- [ ] Optimization recommendations

**Narration Script:**
```
Consumption profiles control spending. But how do you optimize what you're already spending?

Where are inefficiencies? Which models cost most? Which queries need redesign?

Uderia's Cost Analytics dashboard answers with forensic precision.

**COST DISTRIBUTION BY PROVIDER:**

Admin → Cost Analytics → Provider Breakdown. Pie chart:

```
PROVIDER COST DISTRIBUTION (Last 30 Days):

Anthropic (Claude): $127.45 (48.2%) — 342,891 tokens
Google (Gemini): $78.32 (29.6%) — 5,234,782 tokens
OpenAI (GPT-4): $43.21 (16.3%) — 87,432 tokens
AWS Bedrock: $12.18 (4.6%) — 102,341 tokens
Ollama (Local): $3.45 (1.3%) — Infrastructure only
─────────────────────────────────────────────────
Total: $264.61 for 5.77M tokens
```

Story:

**Anthropic dominates cost (48%)** — Claude Sonnet heavily used. Only 342K tokens = high per-token cost. Premium model, premium price.

**Google delivers volume (5.2M tokens)** — Low cost (29.6% spend). Gemini Flash = workhorse for high-volume, low-complexity queries.

**OpenAI expensive per token** — $43 for 87K tokens. GPT-4 costs $0.49/execution average. Use sparingly for complex reasoning only.

**Ollama nearly free** — $3.45 infrastructure, zero API cost. Only 102K tokens. Opportunity: Shift workload to local models.

Breakdown reveals optimization opportunities immediately.

**TOP 5 MOST EXPENSIVE MODELS:**

Click "Model Breakdown" tab. Ranked by total cost:

```
1. Claude Sonnet 3.5 (Anthropic)
   Cost: $89.34 | Tokens: 241,203 | Avg: $0.37/query
   Usage: 243 queries | Profile: @DBA, @QUALITY

2. Gemini 1.5 Flash (Google)
   Cost: $78.32 | Tokens: 5,234,782 | Avg: $0.015/query
   Usage: 5,221 queries | Profile: @ANALYST, @COST

3. GPT-4o (OpenAI)
   Cost: $43.21 | Tokens: 87,432 | Avg: $0.49/query
   Usage: 88 queries | Profile: @PROD (rarely)

4. Claude Opus 3 (Anthropic)
   Cost: $38.11 | Tokens: 101,688 | Avg: $0.95/query
   Usage: 40 queries | Profile: Custom (special projects)

5. Claude Sonnet 3.5 v2 (AWS Bedrock)
   Cost: $12.18 | Tokens: 102,341 | Avg: $0.12/query
   Usage: 101 queries | Profile: @PROD (Bedrock routing)
```

**Key Insight:** Claude Opus ($0.95/query) + GPT-4o ($0.49/query) = only 128 queries. But represent $81 of $264 spend (30.6%).

Optimization: Reserve Opus/GPT-4 for complex reasoning. Use Sonnet or Gemini otherwise. Potential savings: $40-50/month.

**30-DAY COST TREND:**

Click "Trend Analysis" tab. Line chart:

```
DAILY COST (Last 30 Days):

Nov 7: $4.23
Nov 8: $6.45

─────────────────────────────────
Avg Daily: $8.82
Projected Monthly: $264.60
```

Spikes on Nov 20-22 ($12-14/day vs $8 average). Click Nov 20 spike:

```
HIGH-COST SESSIONS (Nov 20):

1. sarah@company.com | Q4_Board_Prep
   Cost: $4.87 | Queries: 23

2. mike@company.com | Customer_Analysis
   Cost: $3.21 | Queries: 47

3. alice@company.com | Performance_Tuning
   Cost: $2.45 | Queries: 12
```

Sarah: 23 expensive queries for Q4 board presentation. Legitimate use case, one-time event.

Mike: 47 queries on customer analysis. Might be inefficient—exploring without clear plan.

**Optimization Opportunity:** Provide Mike with pre-built planner templates for customer analysis. Reduce trial-and-error, cut costs.

**MOST EXPENSIVE SESSIONS:**

Click "Expensive Sessions" tab. Sorted by cost:

```
TOP 10 COSTLIEST SESSIONS (Last 30 Days):

1. Q4_Board_Presentation | sarah@company.com
   Cost: $18.45 | Queries: 67 | Avg: $0.28/query
   Models: Opus (15), Sonnet (52)
   ✓ High-stakes analysis, appropriate selection

2. Database_Migration_Planning | mike@company.com
   Cost: $14.87 | Queries: 31 | Avg: $0.48/query
   Models: GPT-4o (23), Opus (8)
   ✓ Complex reasoning justified premium models

3. Customer_Churn_Exploration | alice@company.com
   Cost: $11.23 | Queries: 89 | Avg: $0.13/query
   Models: Sonnet (67), Flash (22)
   ⚠ Good mix, but 89 queries exploratory
   → Deploy "Customer Insights Playbook"

4. Product_Performance_Deep_Dive | bob@company.com
   Cost: $9.87 | Queries: 156 | Avg: $0.06/query
   Models: Flash (156)
   ⚠ Cost-efficient model, but high query count
   → Consider batch processing or planners
```

Patterns:
- High-stakes sessions (board prep, migrations) justify premium models
- Exploratory sessions (churn, product) would benefit from planners
- High query counts signal inefficiency—users iterating without guidance

**RAG EFFICIENCY SAVINGS:**

Where it gets interesting. Click "RAG Impact" tab.

Uderia tracks two scenarios per query:
1. **Actual cost** (with RAG champion case injection)
2. **Estimated cost without RAG** (cold start, trial-and-error)

```
RAG SAVINGS ANALYSIS (Last 30 Days):

Total Queries with RAG Boost: 1,247 queries
Average Match Quality: 0.78 (good)

COST BREAKDOWN:
Actual (with RAG): $87.34

Budget Alerts and Forecasting—proactive cost management.

**SETTING MONTHLY BUDGET THRESHOLDS:**

Admin → Financial Governance → Budget Configuration:

```
ORGANIZATION BUDGET SETTINGS:

Monthly Budget: $500.00
(Approved LLM spending limit)

ALERT THRESHOLDS:
├─ ⚠️ 50% Warning ($250) → Email to admins
├─ ⚠️ 75% Warning ($375) → Email to admins + finance
├─ 🚨 90% Critical ($450) → Email + Slack + restrict new users
└─ 🛑 100% Exhausted ($500) → Email + Slack + BLOCK non-admin queries

ENFORCEMENT MODE:
• Soft Cap (Alerts only, no blocking) ✓ Selected
• Hard Cap (Block queries when exhausted)
```

Soft Cap—admins get warnings, users aren't blocked. For tighter control, switch to Hard Cap.

Click "Save Budget Settings."

**REAL-TIME SPENDING TRACKER:**

```

Already triggered 50% and 75% warnings. 90% critical alert forecasted for Dec 9 if spending continues at current rate.

**COST FORECASTING:**

Click "View Forecast" tab. Uderia projects spend based on:
1. Historical usage (last 30 days)
2. Current month trajectory (first 7 days)
3. Known upcoming events (user activity patterns)

```
FORECAST MODEL: Linear Projection

Current Spend (Dec 7): $264.61
Daily Average (7 days): $37.80/day
Remaining Days: 24 days

PROJECTED SPEND:
Dec 31 Forecast: $264.61 + (24 × $37.80) = $1,171.81

Budget: $500.00
Projected Overage: $671.81 (234% over budget)

❌ BUDGET BREACH FORECAST: December 13, 2025 (6 days)
```

Alarming. Without intervention, you'll exhaust budget in 6 days and overspend by $671 for the month.

But Uderia also shows alternate scenarios:

```
SCENARIO ANALYSIS:

1. Current Pace (No Changes)
   Dec 31 Total: $1,171.81
   Overage: $671.81

   Deploy planners: -$4.50/month
   Adjusted Daily: $24.75/day (35% reduction)
   Dec 31 Total: $264.61 + (24 × $24.75) = $858.61
   Overage: $358.61
   Likelihood: 60%

3. Aggressive Cost Controls
   All optimizations: -$61.50/month
   Shift 50% to cheaper models: -$80/month
   Batch processing: -$20/month
   Adjusted Daily: $14.20/day (62% reduction)
   Dec 31 Total: $264.61 + (24 × $14.20) = $605.41
   Overage: $105.41
   Likelihood: 40% (requires behavior changes)

4. Budget Increase
   Raise to $1,200/month
   No behavior changes needed
   Dec 31 Total: $1,171.81
   Overage: $0 (within new budget)
   Likelihood: 100% (if finance approves)
```

Admins choose:
- **Optimize** (Scenario 2 or 3)
- **Increase Budget** (Scenario 4)
- **Enforce Hard Cap** (block queries at $500)

**EMAIL ALERT EXAMPLE:**

What admins received when 75% warning triggered (Dec 6):

```
From: uderia-alerts@company.com
To: admin@company.com, finance@company.com, ceo@company.com
Subject: 🚨 LLM Budget Alert: 75% Threshold Reached

─────────────────────────────────────────────────

Hi Team,

Your organization has reached 75% of the monthly LLM budget:

📊 BUDGET STATUS:
Monthly Budget: $500.00
Spent to Date: $377.45 (75.5%)
Remaining: $122.55 (24.5%)
Days Remaining: 25 days

⚠️ PACE WARNING:
Spending 3.2x faster than budget allows
Budget exhausted by: December 13 (19 days early)
Projected month-end: $1,171.81 (234% over budget)

💡 RECOMMENDED ACTIONS:
1. Review Cost Analytics Dashboard
2. Deploy planner repositories to high-usage users
   (potential $61/month savings)
3. Configure consumption profiles to limit high-cost patterns
4. Consider budget increase if justified by business value

🔗 QUICK LINKS:
Cost Analytics Dashboard
Optimization Recommendations
Budget Configuration

Next Alert: 90% threshold ($450) - Forecasted Dec 9

─────────────────────────────────────────────────
Uderia Financial Governance System
```

Actionable email:
- Clear status (75.5% spent)
- Specific warning (exhausted Dec 13)
- Concrete recommendations (deploy planners, configure profiles)
- Direct links (one-click access)

Admins don't guess. They act on data.

**SLACK INTEGRATION:**

Uderia also sends Slack notifications (if configured). In your #finance-alerts channel:

```
🚨 Uderia Budget Alert

75% of monthly LLM budget reached ($377.45 / $500.00)

Projected overage: $671.81 by month-end
Forecast: Budget exhausted by Dec 13 at current pace

```

Real-time visibility. Instant awareness. Immediate action.

**HARD CAP ENFORCEMENT:**

Let's say you decide to enforce a Hard Cap. Go back to Budget Configuration.
**HARD CAP ENFORCEMENT:**

Decide to enforce Hard Cap. Back to Budget Configuration:

```
ENFORCEMENT MODE:
• Soft Cap (Alerts only) ← Current
• Hard Cap (Block queries when exhausted) ✓ Select
```

Save. Simulate reaching 100% budget:

```
Dec 13, 10:23 AM - 🛑 100% BUDGET EXHAUSTED

Spent: $500.00 (100%) | Remaining: $0.00

ENFORCEMENT: HARD CAP ACTIVE

ACTIONS TAKEN:
├─ All non-admin queries BLOCKED
├─ Email sent to admin, finance, ceo
├─ Slack notification to #finance-alerts
└─ User-facing message updated:

   "⚠️ Monthly LLM budget exhausted. Organization reached 
   $500/month limit. Contact administrator to increase budget 
   or wait for reset (Jan 1). Admins can query for emergency 
   operations."
```

Users see when they try to query:

```
🛑 BUDGET LIMIT REACHED

Your organization has exhausted its monthly LLM budget 
($500.00).

Next reset: January 1, 2025 (19 days)

Contact administrator if you need urgent access.
```

Hard Cap protects against runaway costs. No overspend. Absolute control.
But what if CEO needs urgent analysis despite budget exhaustion?
**ADMIN EMERGENCY OVERRIDE:**

CEO needs urgent analysis despite budget exhaustion? Admin action:

```
EMERGENCY EXTENSION:

1. Budget Configuration → "Grant Emergency Extension"
2. Amount: $200 (temporary increase)
3. Expiration: 48 hours
4. Reason: "Q4 board presentation - CEO urgent request"
5. Save
```

Budget temporarily increases to $700. CEO can query. After 48 hours → Extension expires.

Controlled flexibility—governance with emergency escape hatches.
```
SCENARIO: NO BUDGET ALERTS

December spend: $1,171.81 (uncontrolled)
January surprise: Finance reviews bill, shocked
Reaction: "Why did we spend $1,200 on LLMs?!"
Result: Post-facto investigation, no prevention
```

```
SCENARIO: WITH BUDGET ALERTS & FORECASTING

Dec 4: 50% warning → Admin reviews
Dec 6: 75% warning → Optimization deployed
Dec 7-9: Planner repositories deployed, users educated
Result: Daily spend drops to $22/day (42% reduction)
Dec 31 Final: $733 spent (vs $1,171 without action)

Savings: $438 (37% reduction from uncontrolled spending)
```

Proactive alerts prevented $438 in overspend. That's 87% of the original $500 budget.

From "surprised by bills" to "controlling costs in real-time."

From "reactive panic" to "proactive governance."

Budget thresholds. Real-time tracking. Forecasting. Automated alerts. Emergency controls. Financial predictability.

### 8.2 Long-Lived Access Tokens
**Duration:** 3-4 minutes  
**Learning Objectives:**
- Generate long-lived access tokens for API integrations
- Understand token security and scope
- Manage token lifecycle and revocation

**Key Topics to Cover:**
- [ ] Token generation (90 days or 1 year)
- [ ] One-time display security pattern
- [ ] SHA256 hashed storage
- [ ] Usage tracking (last used, count, IP)
- [ ] Token revocation and soft-delete
- [ ] API authentication with tokens

**Narration Script:**
```
JWT session tokens (Module 5.3) expire after 24 hours. Perfect for human users.

But what about CI/CD pipelines? Airflow workflows? Production automation?

Long-Lived Access Tokens—persistent credentials for unattended programmatic access.

**TOKEN GENERATION:**

Admin → API Tokens → "Generate New Token":

```
TOKEN CONFIGURATION:
├─ Name: airflow_prod_pipeline
├─ Description: "Production Airflow DAG for nightly analytics"
├─ Associated User: automation@company.com (service account)
├─ Lifespan: 1 year
├─ Scopes: query:execute, session:read (least privilege)
├─ Profile Restriction: @COST only (prevent expensive models)
└─ Rate Limit: 100/hour, 200/day
```

Click "Generate."

**ONE-TIME DISPLAY:**

Uderia shows:

```
🔐 TOKEN: uderia_sk_live_xK9mP2vL7qR4nT8hS6jY3wZ1aF5cD9bE

⚠️ SECURITY WARNING:
Shown ONCE only. Store securely:
✓ AWS Secrets Manager / HashiCorp Vault
✗ NOT in code repositories
✗ NOT in plaintext files
```

Copy token → Store in AWS Secrets Manager → Click "I Have Saved This Token."

Plaintext disappears forever. Only SHA256 hash stored in database.

**API USAGE:**

Airflow DAG:

```python
import requests
import os

token = os.environ['UDERIA_TOKEN']  # From AWS Secrets

headers = {'Authorization': f'Bearer {token}'}
payload = {'profile': '@COST', 'query': '...'}

response = requests.post(
    'https://uderia.company.com/api/v1/query',
    headers=headers,
    json=payload
)
```

Token authenticates as automation@company.com with limited scope.

**TOKEN MANAGEMENT:**

Admin → API Tokens shows all active tokens:

| Token Name | User | Scopes | Last Used | Created | Expires | Status |
|------------|------|--------|-----------|---------|---------|--------|
| airflow_prod | automation | query:execute | 2h ago | Dec 1 | Dec 1, 2025 | Active |
| legacy_token | old-service | admin:all | 47 days ago | Mar 5 | NEVER | ⚠️ Risky |

**Security red flag:** legacy_token has admin:all scope, never expires, dormant 47 days.

Click "Revoke" → Token immediately invalidated → API calls return 401 Unauthorized.

**TOKEN ROTATION:**

Best practice: Rotate every 90-180 days.

1. Generate new token: airflow_prod_v2
2. Update Airflow with new token
3. Test in staging
4. Deploy to production
5. Verify 1 week
6. Revoke old token

Seamless rotation with zero downtime.

**AUDIT LOGGING:**

Every token operation logged:

```
TOKEN AUDIT LOG:

Dec 7, 10:23 AM - Token Generated
  Name: airflow_prod_v2
  User: automation@company.com
  Scopes: query:execute
  By: admin@company.com

Dec 7, 09:45 AM - Token Revoked
  Name: legacy_token
  Reason: "Over-privileged, dormant"
  By: admin@company.com
```

Forensic accountability for all API access.

From "authentication blocking automation" to "secure, always-on programmatic access."

Long-lived tokens. Scoped permissions. Rotation. Audit trails. Automation enabled.
```

### 9.2 Docker Deployment: Production Setup
**Duration:** 4-5 minutes  
**Learning Objectives:**
- Build Uderia Docker image
- Configure production deployment
- Manage multi-user container

**Key Topics to Cover:**
- [ ] Dockerfile overview
- [ ] Docker Compose configuration
- [ ] Environment variable overrides
- [ ] Volume mounts (sessions, logs, keys)
- [ ] Multi-user shared container
- [ ] Load balancer configuration
- [ ] Horizontal scaling considerations

**Narration Script:**
```
Local development works. Now: production deployment.

Docker containerization for consistent, scalable, multi-user environments.

Uderia includes production-ready `Dockerfile` and `docker-compose.yml`.

**DOCKERFILE OVERVIEW:**

Open `Dockerfile`:

```dockerfile
FROM python:3.13-slim

WORKDIR /app

# Install system dependencies
RUN apt-get update && apt-get install -y \
    gcc postgresql-client curl \
    && rm -rf /var/lib/apt/lists/*

# Copy requirements and install Python packages
COPY requirements.txt .
RUN pip install --no-cache-dir -r requirements.txt

# Copy application code
COPY src/ ./src/
COPY static/ ./static/
COPY templates/ ./templates/
COPY tda_config.json .

# Create directories for persistent data
RUN mkdir -p /app/tda_sessions /app/logs /app/tda_keys

# Expose port
EXPOSE 5000

# Run application
CMD ["python", "src/trusted_data_agent/main.py"]
```

Lightweight base (Python 3.13). Minimal dependencies. Production-ready.

**DOCKER COMPOSE CONFIGURATION:**

Open `docker-compose.yml`:

```yaml
version: '3.8'

services:
  uderia:
    build: .
    container_name: uderia_production
    ports:
      - "5000:5000"
    environment:
      - FLASK_ENV=production
      - JWT_SECRET=${JWT_SECRET}
      - DATABASE_URL=${DATABASE_URL}
      - ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=${ANTHROPIC_API_KEY}
      - GOOGLE_API_KEY=${GOOGLE_API_KEY}
      - OPENAI_API_KEY=${OPENAI_API_KEY}
    volumes:
      - ./tda_sessions:/app/tda_sessions
      - ./logs:/app/logs
      - ./tda_keys:/app/tda_keys
      - ./tda_config.json:/app/tda_config.json
    restart: unless-stopped
    networks:
      - uderia_network

  chromadb:
    image: chromadb/chroma:latest
    container_name: uderia_chromadb
    volumes:
      - chroma_data:/chroma/chroma
    ports:
      - "8000:8000"
    restart: unless-stopped
    networks:
      - uderia_network

volumes:
  chroma_data:

networks:
  uderia_network:
    driver: bridge
```

Two services: Uderia app + ChromaDB vector store.

**ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES:**

Create `.env` file (never commit to Git):

```bash
JWT_SECRET=your-secret-key-here
DATABASE_URL=teradata://prod-server:1025/fitness_db
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=sk-ant-api03-...
GOOGLE_API_KEY=AIza...
OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-proj-...
```

Secure credential management. No hardcoded secrets.

**VOLUME MOUNTS:**

Three critical volumes:

```
1. tda_sessions/ - Multi-user conversation persistence
   ├─ Each user gets isolated directory
   ├─ Survives container restarts
   └─ Example: tda_sessions/82b9231b-.../session.json

2. logs/ - Application and audit logging
   ├─ app.log (General application events)
   ├─ consumption.log (Token usage tracking)
   └─ audit.log (Security events)

3. tda_keys/ - Encrypted credential storage
   ├─ API keys for MCP servers
   ├─ OAuth tokens
   └─ Encrypted at rest (AES-256-GCM)
```

Data persists across deployments.

**BUILD AND RUN:**

Terminal:

```bash
# Build image
docker-compose build

# Start services
docker-compose up -d

# View logs
docker-compose logs -f uderia

# Check status
docker-compose ps
```

Output:

```
NAME                  STATUS    PORTS
uderia_production     Up        0.0.0.0:5000->5000/tcp
uderia_chromadb       Up        0.0.0.0:8000->8000/tcp
```

Both services running. Multi-user ready.

**MULTI-USER ACCESS:**

Single container supports 100+ concurrent users:

```
CONCURRENT SESSIONS:
• User 1: sarah@company.com → Session 82b9... → @ANALYST
• User 2: marcus@company.com → Session f4c2... → @DBA
• User 3: priya@company.com → Session a1d8... → @QUALITY
```

Isolated sessions. Shared infrastructure. Cost-efficient.

**PRODUCTION DEPLOYMENT:**

Deploy to:

```
CLOUD PLATFORMS:
• AWS ECS (Elastic Container Service)
• Google Cloud Run
• Azure Container Instances
• Kubernetes (advanced orchestration)

ADD:
• NGINX reverse proxy (SSL termination, load balancing)
• PostgreSQL for user management (replace SQLite)
• Redis for session caching (optional performance boost)
• Prometheus monitoring
• Grafana dashboards
```

Enterprise-ready architecture.

**HORIZONTAL SCALING:**

Multiple Uderia containers behind load balancer:

```
SCALE ARCHITECTURE:

[Load Balancer]
    |
    ├─ [Uderia Container 1] (users 1-50)
    ├─ [Uderia Container 2] (users 51-100)
    └─ [Uderia Container 3] (users 101-150)
         |
    [Shared ChromaDB]
    [Shared PostgreSQL]
```

Stateless design enables infinite horizontal scaling.

From "local prototype" to "production-grade, multi-user platform."

Docker. Compose. Volumes. Environment variables. Scale with confidence.

### 9.3 Developer Mode & Custom Integrations
**Duration:** 3-4 minutes  
**Learning Objectives:**
- Enable developer features
- Create custom MCP servers
- Build custom integrations

**Key Topics to Cover:**
- [ ] Developer role activation
- [ ] Custom MCP server development
- [ ] Tool/prompt registration
- [ ] Custom prompt templates
- [ ] Plugin system for Planner Repository Constructors
- [ ] REST API extension patterns

**Narration Script:**
```
Uderia provides 6 pre-built profiles. But what if you need custom integrations?

Proprietary systems? Internal APIs? Custom workflows?

Developer Mode unlocks the extensibility layer.

**DEVELOPER ROLE ACTIVATION:**

Admin → Users → Edit your account → Role: **Developer**.

New sidebar menu appears:

```
DEVELOPER MENU:
• 🛠️ Developer Tools
• 📦 Custom MCP Servers
• 🔌 Plugin System
• 📝 Custom Prompts
• 🔍 API Explorer
```

Build a custom integration.

**CUSTOM MCP SERVER:**

Scenario: Company uses **internal ERP system** (not publicly available). Want @ANALYST to query ERP data directly.

Create custom MCP server: `erp_mcp`

**Step 1: Define Tools**

Developer Tools → "Create MCP Server" → `erp_mcp`. Add tool:

```python
TOOL DEFINITION:
name: "erp_getInventory"
description: "Query current inventory levels from ERP"
parameters:
  - product_code: string (required)
  - warehouse: string (optional)
returns: JSON with stock levels, location, reorder status
```

**Step 2: Implement Tool**

Connect to internal ERP API:

```python
import requests

def erp_getInventory(product_code, warehouse=None):
    headers = {'Authorization': f'Bearer {ERP_TOKEN}'}
    params = {'product': product_code}
    if warehouse:
        params['warehouse'] = warehouse
    
    response = requests.get(
        'https://erp.company.com/api/inventory',
        headers=headers,
        params=params
    )
    
    return response.json()
```

**Step 3: Register with Uderia**

Developer Tools → MCP Servers → `erp_mcp` → "Deploy." Uderia validates:

```
VALIDATION:
✓ Tool callable
✓ Parameters schema valid
✓ Authentication working
✓ Response format JSON
```

Tool now available.

**Step 4: Attach to Profile**

Profiles → Edit @ANALYST → Tools → Add `erp_getInventory`. Save profile.

**CUSTOM PROMPT TEMPLATES:**

Create prompt for ERP context:

Developer Tools → Custom Prompts → "Create Prompt"

**Prompt Name:** `erp_inventoryContext`
**Prompt Template:**

```
You have access to internal ERP inventory data.

When analyzing product availability:
1. Query current stock levels with erp_getInventory
2. Check warehouse distribution
3. Flag products below reorder threshold (< 50 units)
4. Recommend restocking priorities

Always include:
- Product code
- Current stock
- Warehouse location
- Days until stockout (if low)
```

Save → Attach to @ANALYST profile.

Now @ANALYST understands ERP context automatically.

**PLUGIN SYSTEM:**

Planner Repository Constructors use plugins for custom case types.

Example: Custom "Procurement Analysis" case type.

Developer Tools → Plugins → "Create Plugin"

**Plugin Name:** `procurement_analysis_plugin`
**Case Type:** Procurement
**Template Structure:**

```python
class ProcurementAnalysisPlugin:
    def extract_metadata(self, conversation):
        return {
            'suppliers': extract_suppliers(conversation),
            'products': extract_products(conversation),
            'cost_metrics': extract_costs(conversation),
            'delivery_times': extract_timelines(conversation)
        }
    
    def champion_criteria(self):
        return {
            'min_cost_savings': 10000,  # $10k minimum
            'supplier_diversity': True,
            'on_time_delivery': '>95%'
        }
```

Deploy plugin → Planner Repositories now support custom case type.

**REST API EXTENSIONS:**

Developer Mode exposes advanced API endpoints:

**Endpoint:** `/api/v1/developer/execute-custom-workflow`

```python
import requests

payload = {
    'workflow': 'multi_profile_pipeline',
    'steps': [
        {'profile': '@ANALYST', 'query': 'Find top revenue products'},
        {'profile': '@DBA', 'query': 'Optimize the SQL query'},
        {'profile': '@QUALITY', 'query': 'Validate data accuracy'}
    ],
    'session_id': '82b9...'
}

response = requests.post(
    'https://uderia.company.com/api/v1/developer/execute-custom-workflow',
    headers={'Authorization': f'Bearer {token}'},
    json=payload
)
```

Orchestrate multiple profiles programmatically. Full control.

**DEBUGGING TOOLS:**

Developer Tools → "Live MCP Debugger"

Test tools in real-time:
- Input: `erp_getInventory(product_code='BIKE-001')`
- Output: `{"stock": 127, "warehouse": "WH-East", "reorder": false}`
- Latency: 234ms

Debug before deploying to profiles.

From "closed platform" to "fully extensible ecosystem."

Custom MCP servers. Plugins. API extensions. Developer Mode. Build anything.

### 10.2 Database Administrator Journey - @DBA Profile
**Duration:** 5-6 minutes  
**Persona:** Marcus, DBA investigating slow query performance  
**Profile Used:** Primarily @DBA, switch to @PROD for API testing

**Learning Objectives:**
- Demonstrate technical SQL optimization workflow
- Show schema analysis and profiling
- Illustrate performance tuning process
- Operationalize optimized query via API

**Scenario Narrative:**
Marcus received complaints that the "Monthly Sales Report" query is taking 45 seconds. He needs to optimize it and deploy the fix.

**Key Topics to Cover:**
- [ ] Analyze current query: "Show me the execution plan for monthly sales aggregation"
- [ ] Schema inspection: Use `base_tableDDL` to examine table structures
- [ ] Identify bottleneck: "What indexes exist on the Sales table?"
- [ ] Data profiling: Use `qlty_profileColumn` to understand data distribution
- [ ] Generate optimized SQL: "Rewrite this query with proper index usage"
- [ ] Benchmark: Compare old vs new execution time
- [ ] Document: "Generate technical documentation for this optimization"
- [ ] Operationalize: Switch to @PROD, test via REST API
- [ ] Deploy: Update Airflow DAG with optimized query

**Narration Script:**
```
Meet Marcus. Database Administrator. 15 years tuning SQL.

Just got paged: "Monthly Sales Report taking 45 seconds. Users complaining."

The report runs 200 times per day. 45 seconds × 200 = 2.5 hours of cumulative wait time daily.

Traditional approach: Request query → Analyze execution plan manually → Research index strategy → Test locally → Document → Deploy → Hope it works.

Uderia approach: Ask. Analyze. Optimize. Validate. Deploy. Done.

**THE INVESTIGATION:**

Marcus logs into Uderia. Profile selector: **@DBA** (Claude Sonnet + database tools).

Chat opens. Profile indicator: "@DBA Active."

**QUERY 1: ANALYZE CURRENT PERFORMANCE**

Marcus types: *"Show me the execution plan and performance for the monthly sales aggregation query"*

He pastes the problematic query:

```sql
SELECT 
    p.ProductName,
    COUNT(*) as SalesCount,
    SUM(s.TotalAmount) as TotalRevenue,
    AVG(s.TotalAmount) as AvgSaleAmount
FROM Sales s
JOIN Products p ON s.ProductID = p.ProductID
WHERE s.SaleDate >= CURRENT_DATE - INTERVAL '30' DAY
GROUP BY p.ProductName
ORDER BY TotalRevenue DESC;
```

@DBA activates:

```
STRATEGIC PLANNING:
├─ Champion case: "Performance_Troubleshooting_Playbooks" (22 cases)
└─ Tool: base_readQuery with EXPLAIN
```

Execution:

```
🔧 Tool: base_readQuery (EXPLAIN mode)
   Analyzing query execution plan...
   
⚠️ PERFORMANCE BOTTLENECK DETECTED:
   • Full table scan on Sales (237,450 rows)
   • No index on SaleDate column
   • JOIN operation: 237K × 1,285 rows = 305M comparisons
   • Execution time: 45.3 seconds
```

Response:

```
PERFORMANCE ANALYSIS: Monthly Sales Report

Current Performance: 45.3 seconds ❌

Execution Plan Issues:
1. Full table scan on Sales table (237,450 rows scanned)
2. No index utilized for SaleDate filter
3. Inefficient JOIN (nested loop with 305M row comparisons)
4. Temporary sort for ORDER BY (67MB memory usage)

Impact:
• Query runs 200x daily
• Cumulative wait time: 2.5 hours/day
• Database load: 15% CPU usage during each execution

Recommendation: Index creation + query restructuring required.
```

Marcus needs to see the schema.

**QUERY 2: SCHEMA INSPECTION**

Marcus: *"Show me the DDL for the Sales table, focusing on indexes and constraints"*

```
🔧 Tool: base_tableDDL
   Table: Sales | Including: Indexes, Primary Keys, Foreign Keys
```

Response:

```sql
CREATE TABLE Sales (
    SaleID INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
    SaleDate DATE NOT NULL,
    CustomerID INTEGER,
    ProductID INTEGER,
    TotalAmount DECIMAL(10,2),
    FOREIGN KEY (CustomerID) REFERENCES Customers(CustomerID),
    FOREIGN KEY (ProductID) REFERENCES Products(ProductID)
);

-- Existing Indexes:
PRIMARY KEY idx_sales_pk ON (SaleID)
-- ⚠️ NO index on SaleDate
-- ⚠️ NO index on ProductID (FK not indexed)

CRITICAL FINDINGS:
1. Missing index on SaleDate (filter column)
2. Missing index on ProductID (JOIN column, despite being FK)
3. Primary key only (SaleID not used in this query)

Schema Issue Confirmed: Date filters and JOINs have no index support.
```

Marcus needs data distribution insights before recommending indexes.

**QUERY 3: DATA PROFILING**

Marcus: *"Profile the SaleDate and ProductID columns to understand data distribution and cardinality"*

```
🔧 Tool: qlty_profileColumn
   Table: Sales | Columns: SaleDate, ProductID
   Analysis: Distribution, cardinality, selectivity
```

Response:

```
COLUMN PROFILING RESULTS:

SaleDate Column:
• Date range: 2022-01-15 to 2024-12-06 (1,056 days)
• Distribution: Relatively uniform (220-240 sales per day)
• Last 30 days: 6,847 rows (2.9% of total)
• Selectivity: High (good index candidate) ✅

ProductID Column:
• Distinct values: 1,285 products
• Distribution: Skewed (top 20 products = 45% of sales)
• Average rows per ProductID: 185
• Selectivity: Moderate (JOIN benefits from index) ✅

INDEX STRATEGY RECOMMENDATION:
1. Composite index: (SaleDate, ProductID) for optimal performance
2. Alternative: Separate indexes if storage constrained
3. Estimated selectivity improvement: 97.1% (access 2.9% of rows, not 100%)
```

Data supports the index strategy. Now: optimization.

**QUERY 4: GENERATE OPTIMIZED QUERY**
**QUERY 4: GENERATE OPTIMIZED QUERY**

Marcus: *"Rewrite this query with optimal index usage and query structure for Teradata"*

```
STRATEGIC PLANNING:
├─ Repository: "DBA_Champion_Cases" (47 cases)
└─ Knowledge: "Teradata SQL Optimization Guide"

🔧 Tool: TDA_LLMTask
   Task: SQL optimization with index hints
   Context: Teradata-specific (COLLECT STATISTICS, index strategy)
```

Response:

```sql
-- Step 1: Create optimal indexes (run ONCE)
CREATE INDEX idx_sales_date_product ON Sales (SaleDate, ProductID);
COLLECT STATISTICS ON Sales COLUMN (SaleDate, ProductID);

-- Step 2: Optimized query structure
SELECT 
    p.ProductName,
    COUNT(*) as SalesCount,
    SUM(s.TotalAmount) as TotalRevenue,
    AVG(s.TotalAmount) as AvgSaleAmount
FROM Sales s
INNER JOIN Products p ON s.ProductID = p.ProductID
WHERE s.SaleDate >= CURRENT_DATE - INTERVAL '30' DAY
GROUP BY p.ProductName
ORDER BY TotalRevenue DESC;

OPTIMIZATION TECHNIQUES APPLIED:
✅ Composite index on (SaleDate, ProductID)
✅ COLLECT STATISTICS for query optimizer
✅ INNER JOIN explicit (same result, clearer intent)
✅ Filter-first strategy (date filter before JOIN reduces rows)

Expected Performance: 2-3 seconds (93% improvement)

**TECHNICAL DOCUMENTATION: Monthly Sales Report Optimization**
*Author: Marcus Chen, DBA*
*Date: December 7, 2024*

**PROBLEM**
Monthly sales aggregation query executing in 45.3 seconds, causing user complaints and database load.

**ROOT CAUSE**
1. Full table scan on Sales table (237,450 rows)
2. No index on SaleDate (date range filter column)
3. No index on ProductID (JOIN column)
4. Inefficient nested loop JOIN

**SOLUTION**
Created composite index: `idx_sales_date_product ON Sales (SaleDate, ProductID)`

**SQL CHANGES**
```sql
-- Index creation
CREATE INDEX idx_sales_date_product ON Sales (SaleDate, ProductID);
COLLECT STATISTICS ON Sales COLUMN (SaleDate, ProductID);

-- Query unchanged (optimizer now uses index automatically)
```

**PERFORMANCE IMPROVEMENT**
- Execution time: 45.3s → 3.2s (93% faster)
- Rows scanned: 237K → 6.8K (97% reduction)
- Daily time saved: 2h 19m across 200 executions
- CPU usage: 15% → 1.2% per execution

**DEPLOYMENT**
- Index created: 2024-12-07 14:23 UTC
- Statistics collected: 2024-12-07 14:25 UTC
- Airflow DAG updated: `monthly_sales_report_optimized.py`
- First production run: 2024-12-08 06:00 UTC

**VALIDATION**
- Query results identical before/after ✅
- Production API tested: 3.2s execution ✅
- No regressions on other queries ✅

**MAINTENANCE**
- Monitor index size (currently 12 MB)
- Re-collect statistics monthly: `COLLECT STATISTICS ON Sales COLUMN (SaleDate, ProductID);`
- Review query plan quarterly

Good overall score. But those issues need investigation.

**QUERY 2: CONSTRAINT VALIDATION DETAILS**

Priya: *"Show me details on the constraint violations found"*

```
🔧 Tool: qlty_validateData (detailed mode)
   Focus: Referential integrity, NULL constraints
```

Response:

**Constraint Violation Details**

**CRITICAL ISSUES (3):**

**1. Orphaned Sales Records** 🔴
- **Table:** Sales
- **Issue:** 437 rows with CustomerID not in Customers table
- **Impact:** Referential integrity violated
- **Sample IDs:** 182547, 189234, 195678 (CustomerID: 9999, 9998, 9997)
- **Root Cause:** Test data not cleaned after migration
- **Remediation:** DELETE or UPDATE with valid CustomerIDs

**2. SaleDetails Price Mismatch** 🔴
- **Table:** SaleDetails
- **Issue:** 12 rows where UnitPrice ≠ Products.Price
- **Impact:** Revenue calculation discrepancies
- **Sample:** SaleDetailID 4523 (UnitPrice: $1,299 vs Products.Price: $1,199)
- **Potential Loss:** $876 revenue misreported
- **Remediation:** Verify pricing rules, correct discrepancies

**3. NULL TotalAmount** 🔴
- **Table:** Sales
- **Issue:** 5 rows with NULL TotalAmount (should be NOT NULL)
- **Impact:** Revenue reporting incomplete
- **SaleIDs:** 234789, 234790, 234812, 235001, 235002
- **Date Range:** December 5-6, 2024 (data entry error?)
- **Remediation:** Calculate and populate from SaleDetails

**WARNINGS (2):**

**4. Duplicate Customer Emails** 🟡
- **Table:** Customers
- **Issue:** 18 email addresses used by multiple CustomerIDs
- **Example:** john.smith@email.com (CustomerID: 1234, 5678)
- **Impact:** Potential data quality issue or valid shared accounts
- **Recommendation:** Review and consolidate or flag as shared

**5. Future ServiceTicket Dates** 🟡
- **Table:** ServiceTickets
- **Issue:** 3 tickets dated in future (TicketDate > CURRENT_DATE)
- **IDs:** 256, 267, 271 (dates: Dec 15-18, 2024)
- **Impact:** Data entry error or system clock issue
- **Remediation:** Correct dates to valid values

**INFO (1):**

**6. Low Stock Products** ℹ️
- **Table:** Products
- **Issue:** 23 products with StockQuantity < 10
- **Impact:** Potential stockout risk (not a data quality issue)
- **Recommendation:** Inventory replenishment (business process)

---

Priya now has specific issues to investigate. Time for detailed profiling.

**QUERY 3: COLUMN PROFILING**

Priya: *"Profile the Sales.TotalAmount column to identify outliers and distribution patterns"*

```
🔧 Tool: qlty_profileColumn
   Table: Sales
   Column: TotalAmount
   Analysis: Distribution, outliers, statistical summary
```

Response:

**Column Profile: Sales.TotalAmount**

**Statistical Summary:**
- **Row Count:** 237,450 (excluding 5 NULLs)
- **Min:** $15.99
- **Max:** $18,450.00
- **Mean:** $875.34
- **Median:** $624.50
- **Std Dev:** $456.23

**Distribution:**
```
$0-500:    ████████████████████████ 45.2% (107,321 rows)
$501-1000: ██████████████ 28.7% (68,128 rows)
$1001-2000: ████████ 18.3% (43,453 rows)
$2001-5000: ███ 6.9% (16,384 rows)
$5000+:     ▌ 0.9% (2,164 rows)
```

**Outliers Detected (3):** 🚨

| SaleID | TotalAmount | Date | ProductID | Status |
|--------|-------------|------|-----------|--------|
| 189456 | **$18,450** | Nov 23 | 1047 | ⚠️ 21x standard deviation |
| 201234 | **$16,890** | Dec 1 | 1047 | ⚠️ 19x standard deviation |
| 198765 | **$0.01** | Nov 30 | 523 | ⚠️ Test transaction? |

**Analysis:**
- **High outliers (2):** ProductID 1047 = "Commercial Gym Bundle" ($18K legitimate)
- **Low outlier (1):** $0.01 likely test/error transaction
- **Recommendation:** Verify $0.01 transaction, flag commercial bundles separately

---

Outliers explained. Now: business rule validation.

**QUERY 4: BUSINESS RULE VALIDATION**

Priya: *"Verify that SaleDetails.UnitPrice matches Products.Price for all sales transactions"*

```
🔧 Tool: base_readQuery
   Query: JOIN SaleDetails → Products
   Validation: UnitPrice consistency check
```

Response:

**Business Rule Validation: Price Consistency**

**Rule:** SaleDetails.UnitPrice MUST equal Products.Price at time of sale

**Validation Results:**
- **Total SaleDetails Records:** 4,892
- **Matching Prices:** 4,880 (99.8%) ✅
- **Price Mismatches:** 12 (0.2%) ❌

**Mismatches Identified:**

| SaleDetailID | ProductName | Expected | Actual | Diff | SaleDate |
|--------------|-------------|----------|--------|------|----------|
| 4523 | ProRunner 3000 | $1,199 | $1,299 | +$100 | Dec 3 |
| 4534 | FlexBench Pro | $899 | $799 | -$100 | Dec 3 |
| 4567 | Yoga Mat Premium | $49 | $59 | +$10 | Dec 4 |
| 4589 | Resistance Bands | $29 | $19 | -$10 | Dec 4 |
| ... | (8 more) | ... | ... | ... | ... |

**Total Revenue Impact:** +$876 (net overcharge)

**Root Cause Hypothesis:**
- All mismatches in Dec 3-4 (same date range)
- Pattern suggests manual price override during promotion
- Promotion pricing not reflected in Products table

**Remediation:**
1. **Immediate:** Correct SaleDetails records or Products.Price
2. **Process:** Implement promotion price tracking
3. **Audit:** Review all December promotional sales

### 10.4 Compliance Officer Journey - @LOCAL Profile
**Duration:** 5-6 minutes  
**Persona:** James, Compliance Officer analyzing customer churn (PII-heavy)  
**Profile Used:** Exclusively @LOCAL (zero cloud exposure)

**Learning Objectives:**
- Demonstrate complete privacy-preserving workflow
- Show identical capabilities with local execution
- Emphasize data sovereignty
- Prove zero compromise on intelligence

**Scenario Narrative:**
James needs to analyze why premium customers are churning, but the analysis involves sensitive PII (names, emails, addresses, purchase history). Regulatory requirements prohibit sending this data to cloud providers.

**Key Topics to Cover:**
- [ ] Profile switch: Activate @LOCAL (Ollama)
- [ ] Verify local execution: "Confirm zero cloud connectivity"
- [ ] Customer analysis: "Identify customers who stopped purchasing in Q4"
- [ ] PII-heavy queries: Full access to names, emails, addresses
- [ ] Purchase pattern analysis: "What products did churned customers previously buy?"
- [ ] Service ticket correlation: "Did they have unresolved support issues?"
- [ ] Demographic insights: Age, location, purchase frequency
- [ ] Generate confidential churn report
- [ ] Emphasize: All data stayed on-premises, zero cloud API calls

**Narration Script:**
```
Meet James. Compliance Officer. Operates under strict regulatory constraints.

Assignment: Analyze why premium customers are churning.

The problem: Analysis requires sensitive PII—full names, email addresses, home addresses, purchase history.

Regulatory requirement: **ZERO data can leave organizational boundaries.**

GDPR. CCPA. Industry regulations. Data sovereignty non-negotiable.

Traditional cloud approach: BLOCKED. Cannot send PII to Anthropic, OpenAI, or Google.

Alternative: Build custom on-prem solution → 6 months development, $300K budget.

Uderia approach: **@LOCAL profile. Same intelligence. Zero cloud.**

**THE SOVEREIGNTY WORKFLOW:**

James logs into Uderia. Profile selector shows 6 options.

He selects **@LOCAL** (Ollama Llama 3.1 70B - On-Premises).

Chat opens. Profile indicator: "@LOCAL Active - 100% On-Premises Execution"

**System banner appears:**

## THE GOD MODE SUMMARY

Elena started at 2:00 PM. Finished at 2:08 PM.

**Profile orchestration:**

✅ **@QUALITY** (45s) - Data validation, 99.2% quality score, 2 issues flagged
✅ **@DBA** (50s) - Query optimization, 12.3s → 1.8s (85% faster)
✅ **@ANALYST** (65s) - Business intelligence, 4 visualizations, 3 recommendations
✅ **@LOCAL** (70s) - PII analysis, 47 customers identified, zero cloud exposure
✅ **@PROD** (80s) - Production deployment, Airflow DAG, weekly automation

**Total Time:** 8 minutes (including thinking time: ~12 minutes)

**Deliverables:**
1. ✅ Data quality report (99.2% score)
2. ✅ Optimized SQL query (85% performance gain)
3. ✅ Executive dashboard (4 visualizations, segmentation analysis)
4. ✅ Confidential retention list (47 customers with PII)
5. ✅ Production pipeline (Airflow DAG, weekly execution)

**Traditional Approach:**

**Team Required:**
- Priya (Quality Analyst) - 4 hours
- Marcus (DBA) - 3 hours
- Sarah (Business Analyst) - 4 hours
- James (Compliance) - 2 hours
- Data Engineer (Production) - 3 hours

**Coordination:**
- Kickoff meeting - 30 min
- Mid-point sync - 45 min
- Final review - 45 min

**Total:** 5 people × 3 days = 18 hours of work + 2 hours meetings

**Bottlenecks:**
- Waiting for quality validation before optimization
- Waiting for optimization before analysis
- Waiting for compliance review before retention targeting
- Waiting for everything before deployment
- Back-and-forth iterations at each handoff

**Uderia God Mode:**

**Team Required:** Elena (1 person)

**Time:** 8 minutes execution + 4 minutes thinking = 12 minutes total

**Bottlenecks:** ZERO. Seamless profile switching with context retention.

**The Difference:**

| Dimension | Traditional | Uderia God Mode | Improvement |
|-----------|-------------|-----------------|-------------|
| **People** | 5 specialists | 1 person | 80% reduction |
| **Time** | 3 days (18 hours) | 12 minutes | **99.3%** faster |
| **Meetings** | 3 coordination sessions | 0 | 100% elimination |
| **Handoffs** | 4 handoffs (friction points) | 0 | Seamless flow |
| **Context Loss** | High (explain at each step) | 0 | Perfect retention |
| **Iterations** | Slow (days per cycle) | Instant | Real-time refinement |

**THE COMPOUNDING POWER:**

Each profile contributed specialized expertise:

🔬 **@QUALITY:** Caught 2 data issues that would have corrupted analysis
⚙️ **@DBA:** Delivered 85% performance gain (12.3s → 1.8s)
📊 **@ANALYST:** Generated executive visualizations and actionable insights
🔒 **@LOCAL:** Handled sensitive PII without regulatory risk
🚀 **@PROD:** Operationalized entire workflow for ongoing automation

**Alone, each profile is powerful.**
**Together, orchestrated by one person, they're unstoppable.**

**THIS IS GOD MODE.**

One person commanding a team of specialized AI personas.

No coordination overhead.
No knowledge handoffs.
No waiting.
No friction.

Pure, compounded intelligence.

Elena went from "executive mandate" to "fully deployed production pipeline" in 12 minutes.

**Traditional team:** 5 people, 3 days, countless meetings.
**Elena with Uderia:** 1 person, 12 minutes, zero meetings.

This is the future.

Not replacing specialists.

**Empowering one person to orchestrate all of them.**

This is @QUALITY + @DBA + @ANALYST + @LOCAL + @PROD.

This is Uderia.

**This is God Mode.**
