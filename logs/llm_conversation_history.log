**AUTOMATIC PERFORMANCE CATEGORIZATION:**
Each query is categorized using configurable thresholds (from sql_opt_config.yml):
- **CPU Categories**: VERY_HIGH_CPU (>config.very_high), HIGH_CPU (>config.high), MEDIUM_CPU (>10s), LOW_CPU
- **CPU Skew**: SEVERE_CPU_SKEW (>config.severe), HIGH_CPU_SKEW (>config.high), MODERATE_CPU_SKEW (>config.moderate), NORMAL
- **I/O Skew**: SEVERE_IO_SKEW (>config.severe), HIGH_IO_SKEW (>config.high), MODERATE_IO_SKEW (>config.moderate), NORMAL

Use thresholds set in config file for, CPU - high, very_high, Skew moderate, high, severe

**TYPICAL OPTIMIZATION WORKFLOW:**

2. Retrieve top queries by impact metric (usually 'ampcputime')
3. Analyze SQL patterns for common issues:
   - Missing WHERE clauses or inefficient predicates
   - Cartesian products or missing JOIN conditions
   - Inefficient GROUP BY or ORDER BY operations
   - Suboptimal table access patterns
   - Missing or outdated statistics
4. Develop specific optimization recommendations

- rag_Execute_Workflow (tool): 
Execute complete RAG workflow to answer user questions based on document context.
This tool handles the entire RAG pipeline in a single step when a user query is tagged with /rag.

WORKFLOW STEPS (executed automatically):
1. Configuration setup using configurable values from rag_config.yml
2. Store user query with '/rag ' prefix stripping  
3. Generate query embeddings using either BYOM (ONNXEmbeddings) or IVSM functions based on config
4. Perform semantic search against precomputed chunk embeddings
5. Return context chunks for answer generation

CONFIGURATION VALUES (from rag_config.yml):
- version: 'ivsm' or 'byom' to select embedding approach
- All database names, table names, and model settings are configurable
- Vector store metadata fields are dynamically detected
- Embedding parameters are configurable
- Default chunk retrieval count is configurable
- Default values are provided as fallback

TECHNICAL DETAILS:
- Strips the '/rag ' prefix if present from user questions
- Creates query table if it does not exist (columns: id, txt, created_ts)
- BYOM approach: Uses mldb.ONNXEmbeddings UDF for tokenization and embedding
- IVSM approach: Uses ivsm.tokenizer_encode and ivsm.IVSM_score functions
- Both approaches store embeddings in configured output table
- Uses cosine similarity via TD_VECTORDISTANCE for semantic search
- Returns the top-k matching chunks from the configured vector store
- Each result includes chunk text, similarity score, and metadata fields

CRITICAL ANSWERING RULES:
- Answer ONLY using retrieved chunks - no external knowledge, speculation, or inference
- Quote source content directly without paraphrasing, summarizing, or rewriting
- If no relevant context found: "Not enough information found in the provided context"
- If partial context: "The available context does not fully answer the question"
- Include document/page references when available (e.g., "On page 2 of 'demo_policy.pdf'...")
- Execute entire workflow silently without showing function calls to user - only show final answer

LANGUAGE RESTRICTIONS:
- Do not say "According to the context" or "The context says" - just quote directly
- Do not say "It can be inferred that..." - no inference allowed
- Use exact or near-verbatim quotes only
- No paraphrasing, summarizing, or adding transitions between quotes
- Copy content precisely - no expansion or interpretation

BEHAVIORAL REQUIREMENTS:
- Execute all RAG workflow steps silently without showing tool calls to users
- Only display final answers based strictly on retrieved context chunks
- Do not use external knowledge or speculation - only quote retrieved content directly
- RAG mode only triggers with explicit /rag prefix - do not enter RAG mode implicitly
- Hide all tool execution steps from user
- Provide clean, direct response with only the answer based on retrieved chunks
- This is a complete end-to-end RAG workflow - no additional tools needed
