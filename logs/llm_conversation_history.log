--- REASON FOR CALL ---
Generating a strategic meta-plan for the goal: 'is there a fitness database on the system'

[user]: You are a helpful assistant.
[model]: Understood.

--- Current User Prompt (with System Prompt) ---
SYSTEM PROMPT:

# Core Directives
You are a specialized assistant for a Teradata database system. Your primary goal is to fulfill user requests by selecting the best capability (a tool or a prompt) from the categorized lists provided and supplying all necessary arguments.

# Response Format
Your response MUST be a single JSON object for a tool/prompt call OR a single plain text string for a final answer.

1.  **Tool/Prompt Calls (JSON format):**
    -   If the capability is a prompt, you MUST use the key `"prompt_name"`.
    -   If the capability is a tool, you MUST use the key `"tool_name"`.
    -   Provide all required arguments. Infer values from the conversation history if necessary.
    -   Example (Prompt): `{"prompt_name": "some_prompt", "arguments": {"arg": "value"}}`
    -   Example (Tool): `{"tool_name": "some_tool", "arguments": {"arg": "value"}}`

2.  **Final Answer (Plain Text format):**
    -   When you have sufficient information to fully answer the user's request, you MUST stop using tools.
    -   Your response MUST begin with the exact prefix `FINAL_ANSWER:`, followed by a natural language summary.
    -   Example: `FINAL_ANSWER: I found 48 databases on the system. The details are displayed below.`

# Decision Process
To select the correct capability, you MUST follow this two-step process, governed by one critical rule:

**CRITICAL RULE: Follow this strict hierarchy for capability selection:**
1.  **Prioritize Pre-defined Analysis/Reports (Prompts):** If the user's request is for an **analysis, description, or summary** that is a strong semantic match for an available `prompt`, you **MUST** select that `prompt_name`. Prompts are the preferred method for generating these pre-defined analytical outputs.
2.  **Default to Direct Actions (Tools):** If no analytical prompt is a direct match, or if the user's request is a direct command (e.g., "list...", "count...", "show me..."), you **MUST** treat the request as a direct action. Select the most specific `tool_name` that fulfills this action.

**CRITICAL RULE (Planner Efficiency):** You **MUST NOT** create a multi-phase plan using tools if the user's goal can be fully achieved by a single, available prompt. If a prompt exists that matches the user's request for an analysis or report, you **MUST** call that prompt directly. Do not create a plan that manually replicates the function of an existing prompt.

# Few-Shot Examples
Here are examples of the correct thinking process:

**Example 1: Direct Action Request**
- **User Query:** "what is the quality of table 'online' in database 'DEMO_Customer360_db'?"
- **Thought Process:**
    1. The user's request is about "quality," but it's a direct question, not a request for a broad "description" or "summary." No prompt for a pre-defined analysis is a perfect match.
    2. Therefore, I move to step 2 of my critical rule: treat this as a direct action.
    3. The user's query is about a **table**. I must choose a table-level tool.
    4. The `qlty_columnSummary` tool takes a `table_name` and is the most specific, correct choice for this direct action.
- **Correct Response:** `{"tool_name": "qlty_columnSummary", "arguments": {"database_name": "DEMO_Customer360_db", "table_name": "online"}}`

**Example 2: Pre-defined Analysis Request**
- **User Query:** "describe the business purpose of the 'DEMO_Customer360_db' database"
- **Thought Process:**
    1. The user's request is for a "business purpose" description, which is a pre-defined analysis. I will check for a matching prompt first.
    2. The `base_databaseBusinessDesc` prompt is described as being for this exact purpose. It is a strong semantic match.
    3. According to my critical rule, I **MUST** select this prompt. I am forbidden from creating a multi-step plan to get the DDL and then summarize it.
- **Correct Response:** `{"prompt_name": "base_databaseBusinessDesc", "arguments": {"database_name": "DEMO_Customer360_db"}}`

# Best Practices
- **Context is Key:** Always use information from previous turns to fill in arguments like `database_name` or `table_name`.
- **Error Recovery:** If a tool fails, analyze the error message and attempt to call the tool again with corrected parameters. Only ask the user for clarification if you cannot recover.
- **SQL Generation:** When using the `base_readQuery` tool, you MUST use fully qualified table names in your SQL (e.g., `SELECT ... FROM my_database.my_table`).
- **Time-Sensitive Queries:** For queries involving relative dates (e.g., 'today', 'this week'), you MUST use the `util_getCurrentDate` tool first to determine the current date before proceeding.
- **Out of Scope:** If the user's request is unrelated to the available capabilities, respond with a `FINAL_ANSWER:` that politely explains you cannot fulfill the request and restates your purpose.
- **CRITICAL: Avoid Repetitive Behavior.** You are a highly intelligent agent. Do not get stuck in a loop by repeating the same tool calls or by cycling through the same set of tools. Once a tool has returned a successful result with data that is relevant to the user's request, do not call that same tool again unless there is a new and compelling reason to do so. If you have called a series of tools and believe you have enough information, you must call a FINAL_ANSWER. Do not repeat tool calls just to be "through".

USER PROMPT:

You are an expert strategic planning assistant. Your task is to analyze a user's request or a complex workflow goal and decompose it into a high-level, phased meta-plan. This plan will serve as a state machine executor.

---
### Critical Directives
You MUST follow these directives in order to create a valid and efficient plan.



1.  **Analyze Goal and Context**: First, carefully read the user's `GOAL` and review the `CONTEXT` section to understand the full intent and what actions have already been taken.
    
    

2.  **Identify Conversational Turns**: If the user's `GOAL` is purely conversational (e.g., a greeting like "hello") and does not require any data or action, your response **MUST be a single JSON object**: `{"plan_type": "conversational", "response": "I'm doing well, thank you for asking! How can I help you with your Teradata database system today?"}`.

3.  **Handle Context and Parameters Correctly**:
    * **Prioritize the Goal**: You **MUST** prioritize entities from the user's current `GOAL` over conflicting information in the `Workflow History`. The history is for supplementing missing information, not for overriding the current request.
    * **Extract Parameters**: You **MUST** meticulously scan the `GOAL` for entities that correspond to tool arguments (e.g., table names) and populate the `"arguments"` block in your plan phase with these key-value pairs.

4.  **Follow the Plan Architecture**:
    * Your plan **MUST** follow a strict "data-gathering first, synthesis last" architecture.
    * If the goal requires a final summary, the plan **MUST** conclude with a single phase that uses the `CoreLLMTask` tool. The `task_description` for this phase **MUST** be the complete and verbatim text of the main `GOAL` to ensure all original context is preserved.

5.  **Optimize for Efficiency**:
    * Your plan **MUST** be as efficient as possible. Combine multiple steps into a single phase if one tool can perform the combined operation.
    * **CRITICAL STRATEGY (Query Pushdown Efficiency)**: Always prefer a single action that filters data at the source over multiple steps that retrieve unfiltered data and then filter it.
        * **HIGHLY PREFERRED:** Use a tool that accepts a filter (e.g., a `sql` parameter with a `WHERE` clause) to request *only the specific data you need*.
        * **AVOID IF POSSIBLE:** Do not use a general-purpose "list" tool and then follow it with a second phase to find a specific item.

6.  **Maintain Simplicity and Focus**:
    * If the `GOAL` can be answered with a single tool call, your plan **MUST** consist of only that single phase. Do not add unnecessary synthesis phases for simple data retrieval.
    * Every phase **MUST** correspond to a concrete, executable action. Do **NOT** create phases for simple verification or acknowledgement.

7.  **Adhere to Structural Rules**:
    * **CRITICAL RULE (Plan Flattening)**: Your plan **MUST ALWAYS** be a flat, sequential list of phases. You **MUST NOT** create nested structures. Decompose tasks with nested logic into multiple, sequential looping phases.
    * **CRITICAL RULE (Capability Type Enforcement)**: Your selection **MUST** strictly adhere to the capability type. You are **forbidden** from placing a `(prompt)` in the `"relevant_tools"` list or a `(tool)` in the `"executable_prompt"` field.

8.  **Ensure Stability**:
    * **CRITICAL RULE (Recursion Prevention)**: Review the `Current Execution Depth`. You **MUST NOT** create a plan that calls an `executable_prompt` if the depth is approaching the maximum of 5. If you are already inside an `Active Prompt`, you **MUST NOT** create a plan that calls that same prompt again.

---
### Plan JSON Structure
Your output **MUST** be a single, valid JSON array of phase objects. Each object must follow this structure:

-   `"phase"`: An integer, starting from 1.
-   `"goal"`: A concise string describing what this phase will accomplish. You MUST embed any relevant parameters from the user's goal directly into this string.
-   `"type"`: (Optional) Use `"loop"` if the phase needs to iterate over the results of a previous phase.
-   `"loop_over"`: (Required if `type` is `"loop"`) A string identifying the source of items to loop over (e.g., `"result_of_phase_1"`).
-   `"relevant_tools"`: A JSON array containing the single string name of the `(tool)` to be used in this phase.
-   `"executable_prompt"`: A string name of the `(prompt)` to be used in this phase.
-   `"arguments"`: (Optional) A JSON object of key-value pairs for the selected capability. You can use placeholders like `"result_of_phase_1"` to pass data between phases.

---
### EXAMPLE (Flattening Nested Logic)
-   **User Goal**: "For each database on the system, get the DDL for all of its tables."
-   **Correct Plan**:
    ```json
    [
      {
        "phase": 1,
        "goal": "First, get a list of all databases on the system.",
        "relevant_tools": ["base_listDatabases"]
      },
      {
        "phase": 2,
        "goal": "Now, loop over the list of databases gathered in Phase 1 and get the list of tables for each one.",
        "type": "loop",
        "loop_over": "result_of_phase_1",
        "relevant_tools": ["base_listTables"]
      },
      {
        "phase": 3,
        "goal": "Finally, loop over the flattened list of tables gathered in Phase 2 and get the DDL for each one.",
        "type": "loop",
        "loop_over": "result_of_phase_2",
        "relevant_tools": ["base_tableDDL"]
      }
    ]

[user]: You are a helpful assistant.
[model]: Understood.
[user]: SYSTEM PROMPT:

# Core Directives
You are a specialized assistant for a Teradata database system. Your primary goal is to fulfill user requests by selecting the best capability (a tool or a prompt) from the categorized lists provided and supplying all necessary arguments.

# Response Format
Your response MUST be a single JSON object for a tool/prompt call OR a single plain text string for a final answer.

1.  **Tool/Prompt Calls (JSON format):**
    -   If the capability is a prompt, you MUST use the key `"prompt_name"`.
    -   If the capability is a tool, you MUST use the key `"tool_name"`.
    -   Provide all required arguments. Infer values from the conversation history if necessary.
    -   Example (Prompt): `{"prompt_name": "some_prompt", "arguments": {"arg": "value"}}`
    -   Example (Tool): `{"tool_name": "some_tool", "arguments": {"arg": "value"}}`

2.  **Final Answer (Plain Text format):**
    -   When you have sufficient information to fully answer the user's request, you MUST stop using tools.
    -   Your response MUST begin with the exact prefix `FINAL_ANSWER:`, followed by a natural language summary.
    -   Example: `FINAL_ANSWER: I found 48 databases on the system. The details are displayed below.`

# Decision Process
To select the correct capability, you MUST follow this two-step process, governed by one critical rule:

**CRITICAL RULE: Follow this strict hierarchy for capability selection:**
1.  **Prioritize Pre-defined Analysis/Reports (Prompts):** If the user's request is for an **analysis, description, or summary** that is a strong semantic match for an available `prompt`, you **MUST** select that `prompt_name`. Prompts are the preferred method for generating these pre-defined analytical outputs.
2.  **Default to Direct Actions (Tools):** If no analytical prompt is a direct match, or if the user's request is a direct command (e.g., "list...", "count...", "show me..."), you **MUST** treat the request as a direct action. Select the most specific `tool_name` that fulfills this action.

**CRITICAL RULE (Planner Efficiency):** You **MUST NOT** create a multi-phase plan using tools if the user's goal can be fully achieved by a single, available prompt. If a prompt exists that matches the user's request for an analysis or report, you **MUST** call that prompt directly. Do not create a plan that manually replicates the function of an existing prompt.

# Few-Shot Examples
Here are examples of the correct thinking process:

**Example 1: Direct Action Request**
- **User Query:** "what is the quality of table 'online' in database 'DEMO_Customer360_db'?"
- **Thought Process:**
    1. The user's request is about "quality," but it's a direct question, not a request for a broad "description" or "summary." No prompt for a pre-defined analysis is a perfect match.
    2. Therefore, I move to step 2 of my critical rule: treat this as a direct action.
    3. The user's query is about a **table**. I must choose a table-level tool.
    4. The `qlty_columnSummary` tool takes a `table_name` and is the most specific, correct choice for this direct action.
- **Correct Response:** `{"tool_name": "qlty_columnSummary", "arguments": {"database_name": "DEMO_Customer360_db", "table_name": "online"}}`

**Example 2: Pre-defined Analysis Request**
- **User Query:** "describe the business purpose of the 'DEMO_Customer360_db' database"
- **Thought Process:**
    1. The user's request is for a "business purpose" description, which is a pre-defined analysis. I will check for a matching prompt first.
    2. The `base_databaseBusinessDesc` prompt is described as being for this exact purpose. It is a strong semantic match.
    3. According to my critical rule, I **MUST** select this prompt. I am forbidden from creating a multi-step plan to get the DDL and then summarize it.
- **Correct Response:** `{"prompt_name": "base_databaseBusinessDesc", "arguments": {"database_name": "DEMO_Customer360_db"}}`

# Best Practices
- **Context is Key:** Always use information from previous turns to fill in arguments like `database_name` or `table_name`.
- **Error Recovery:** If a tool fails, analyze the error message and attempt to call the tool again with corrected parameters. Only ask the user for clarification if you cannot recover.
- **SQL Generation:** When using the `base_readQuery` tool, you MUST use fully qualified table names in your SQL (e.g., `SELECT ... FROM my_database.my_table`).
- **Time-Sensitive Queries:** For queries involving relative dates (e.g., 'today', 'this week'), you MUST use the `util_getCurrentDate` tool first to determine the current date before proceeding.
- **Out of Scope:** If the user's request is unrelated to the available capabilities, respond with a `FINAL_ANSWER:` that politely explains you cannot fulfill the request and restates your purpose.
- **CRITICAL: Avoid Repetitive Behavior.** You are a highly intelligent agent. Do not get stuck in a loop by repeating the same tool calls or by cycling through the same set of tools. Once a tool has returned a successful result with data that is relevant to the user's request, do not call that same tool again unless there is a new and compelling reason to do so. If you have called a series of tools and believe you have enough information, you must call a FINAL_ANSWER. Do not repeat tool calls just to be "through".

USER PROMPT:

You are an expert strategic planning assistant. Your task is to analyze a user's request or a complex workflow goal and decompose it into a high-level, phased meta-plan. This plan will serve as a state machine executor.

---
### Critical Directives
You MUST follow these directives in order to create a valid and efficient plan.



1.  **Analyze Goal and Context**: First, carefully read the user's `GOAL` and review the `CONTEXT` section to understand the full intent and what actions have already been taken.
    
    

2.  **Identify Conversational Turns**: If the user's `GOAL` is purely conversational (e.g., a greeting like "hello") and does not require any data or action, your response **MUST be a single JSON object**: `{"plan_type": "conversational", "response": "I'm doing well, thank you for asking! How can I help you with your Teradata database system today?"}`.

3.  **Handle Context and Parameters Correctly**:
    * **Prioritize the Goal**: You **MUST** prioritize entities from the user's current `GOAL` over conflicting information in the `Workflow History`. The history is for supplementing missing information, not for overriding the current request.
    * **Extract Parameters**: You **MUST** meticulously scan the `GOAL` for entities that correspond to tool arguments (e.g., table names) and populate the `"arguments"` block in your plan phase with these key-value pairs.

4.  **Follow the Plan Architecture**:
    * Your plan **MUST** follow a strict "data-gathering first, synthesis last" architecture.
    * If the goal requires a final summary, the plan **MUST** conclude with a single phase that uses the `CoreLLMTask` tool. The `task_description` for this phase **MUST** be the complete and verbatim text of the main `GOAL` to ensure all original context is preserved.

5.  **Optimize for Efficiency**:
    * Your plan **MUST** be as efficient as possible. Combine multiple steps into a single phase if one tool can perform the combined operation.
    * **CRITICAL STRATEGY (Query Pushdown Efficiency)**: Always prefer a single action that filters data at the source over multiple steps that retrieve unfiltered data and then filter it.
        * **HIGHLY PREFERRED:** Use a tool that accepts a filter (e.g., a `sql` parameter with a `WHERE` clause) to request *only the specific data you need*.
        * **AVOID IF POSSIBLE:** Do not use a general-purpose "list" tool and then follow it with a second phase to find a specific item.

6.  **Maintain Simplicity and Focus**:
    * If the `GOAL` can be answered with a single tool call, your plan **MUST** consist of only that single phase. Do not add unnecessary synthesis phases for simple data retrieval.
    * Every phase **MUST** correspond to a concrete, executable action. Do **NOT** create phases for simple verification or acknowledgement.

7.  **Adhere to Structural Rules**:
    * **CRITICAL RULE (Plan Flattening)**: Your plan **MUST ALWAYS** be a flat, sequential list of phases. You **MUST NOT** create nested structures. Decompose tasks with nested logic into multiple, sequential looping phases.
    * **CRITICAL RULE (Capability Type Enforcement)**: Your selection **MUST** strictly adhere to the capability type. You are **forbidden** from placing a `(prompt)` in the `"relevant_tools"` list or a `(tool)` in the `"executable_prompt"` field.

8.  **Ensure Stability**:
    * **CRITICAL RULE (Recursion Prevention)**: Review the `Current Execution Depth`. You **MUST NOT** create a plan that calls an `executable_prompt` if the depth is approaching the maximum of 5. If you are already inside an `Active Prompt`, you **MUST NOT** create a plan that calls that same prompt again.

---
### Plan JSON Structure
Your output **MUST** be a single, valid JSON array of phase objects. Each object must follow this structure:

-   `"phase"`: An integer, starting from 1.
-   `"goal"`: A concise string describing what this phase will accomplish. You MUST embed any relevant parameters from the user's goal directly into this string.
-   `"type"`: (Optional) Use `"loop"` if the phase needs to iterate over the results of a previous phase.
-   `"loop_over"`: (Required if `type` is `"loop"`) A string identifying the source of items to loop over (e.g., `"result_of_phase_1"`).
-   `"relevant_tools"`: A JSON array containing the single string name of the `(tool)` to be used in this phase.
-   `"executable_prompt"`: A string name of the `(prompt)` to be used in this phase.
-   `"arguments"`: (Optional) A JSON object of key-value pairs for the selected capability. You can use placeholders like `"result_of_phase_1"` to pass data between phases.

---
### EXAMPLE (Flattening Nested Logic)
-   **User Goal**: "For each database on the system, get the DDL for all of its tables."
-   **Correct Plan**:
    ```json
    [
      {
        "phase": 1,
        "goal": "First, get a list of all databases on the system.",
        "relevant_tools": ["base_listDatabases"]
      },
      {
        "phase": 2,

--- Current User Prompt (with System Prompt) ---
SYSTEM PROMPT:
You are a JSON-only responding assistant.

USER PROMPT:

You are an expert system that classifies tasks for a data agent based on a description. Your only job is to determine if a task is 'aggregation' or 'synthesis'.

- 'aggregation': A simple, repetitive task that can be performed on all items at once in a single batch. Examples: counting items, listing names, extracting a single fact from each item, simple formatting.
- 'synthesis': A complex, generative task that requires deep context and is best performed individually for each item. Examples: writing a detailed business description, providing a deep analysis, explaining complex concepts.

You MUST respond with ONLY a single, valid JSON object with one key, "classification".

Example for an aggregation task:
{"classification": "aggregation"}

Example for a synthesis task:
{"classification": "synthesis"}

--- TASK DESCRIPTION TO CLASSIFY ---
Check if the database name contains 'fitness'.


2025-09-06 11:00:31,826 - --- FULL CONTEXT (Session: f704e2b4-a2f8-4aa6-83ca-062a693801e2) ---
--- REASON FOR CALL ---
Executing CoreLLMTask: 
You are an expert data analyst. Your task is to create a final report for the user based on the provided data and their original question.

--- INSTRUCTIONS ---
Your entire response MUST be formatted in standard markdown and MUST be structured as follows:

1.  **(Optional) Key Metric:** If the answer to the user's question can be summarized by a single primary value (either quantitative like a number, or qualitative like a status), you MUST provide it on the very first line in a specific JSON format. The line must start with `Key Metric: ` followed by a JSON object with a `value` (as a string) and a `label` (a short description).
    - Quantitative Example: `Key Metric: {"value": "21", "label": "Databases on system"}`
    - Qualitative Example: `Key Metric: {"value": "High", "label": "System Utilization"}`
    If there is no single primary value, you MUST omit this line entirely.
2.  **The Direct Answer:** This part MUST immediately follow the Key Metric (or be the first line if no metric is provided). It must be a single, concise sentence that directly and factually answers the user's question.
3.  **Key Observations:** This section MUST start with a level-2 markdown heading (`## Key Observations`). It should contain a bulleted list of all supporting details and context.
4.  **CRITICAL RULE (Observations Content):** The 'Key Observations' section is for **textual insights only**. You **MUST NOT** include raw data, code blocks (like SQL), or titles for data that is presented elsewhere (e.g., 'DDL for table_x:'). Your observations should be narrative sentences that describe what the data means.


--- History (History Disabled for LLM Call: False) ---
[user]: You are a helpful assistant.
[model]: Understood.
[user]: SYSTEM PROMPT:

# Core Directives
You are a specialized assistant for a Teradata database system. Your primary goal is to fulfill user requests by selecting the best capability (a tool or a prompt) from the categorized lists provided and supplying all necessary arguments.

# Response Format
Your response MUST be a single JSON object for a tool/prompt call OR a single plain text string for a final answer.

1.  **Tool/Prompt Calls (JSON format):**
    -   If the capability is a prompt, you MUST use the key `"prompt_name"`.
    -   If the capability is a tool, you MUST use the key `"tool_name"`.
    -   Provide all required arguments. Infer values from the conversation history if necessary.
    -   Example (Prompt): `{"prompt_name": "some_prompt", "arguments": {"arg": "value"}}`
    -   Example (Tool): `{"tool_name": "some_tool", "arguments": {"arg": "value"}}`

2.  **Final Answer (Plain Text format):**
    -   When you have sufficient information to fully answer the user's request, you MUST stop using tools.
    -   Your response MUST begin with the exact prefix `FINAL_ANSWER:`, followed by a natural language summary.
    -   Example: `FINAL_ANSWER: I found 48 databases on the system. The details are displayed below.`

# Decision Process
To select the correct capability, you MUST follow this two-step process, governed by one critical rule:

**CRITICAL RULE: Follow this strict hierarchy for capability selection:**
1.  **Prioritize Pre-defined Analysis/Reports (Prompts):** If the user's request is for an **analysis, description, or summary** that is a strong semantic match for an available `prompt`, you **MUST** select that `prompt_name`. Prompts are the preferred method for generating these pre-defined analytical outputs.
2.  **Default to Direct Actions (Tools):** If no analytical prompt is a direct match, or if the user's request is a direct command (e.g., "list...", "count...", "show me..."), you **MUST** treat the request as a direct action. Select the most specific `tool_name` that fulfills this action.

**CRITICAL RULE (Planner Efficiency):** You **MUST NOT** create a multi-phase plan using tools if the user's goal can be fully achieved by a single, available prompt. If a prompt exists that matches the user's request for an analysis or report, you **MUST** call that prompt directly. Do not create a plan that manually replicates the function of an existing prompt.

# Few-Shot Examples
Here are examples of the correct thinking process:

**Example 1: Direct Action Request**
- **User Query:** "what is the quality of table 'online' in database 'DEMO_Customer360_db'?"
- **Thought Process:**
    1. The user's request is about "quality," but it's a direct question, not a request for a broad "description" or "summary." No prompt for a pre-defined analysis is a perfect match.
    2. Therefore, I move to step 2 of my critical rule: treat this as a direct action.
    3. The user's query is about a **table**. I must choose a table-level tool.
    4. The `qlty_columnSummary` tool takes a `table_name` and is the most specific, correct choice for this direct action.
- **Correct Response:** `{"tool_name": "qlty_columnSummary", "arguments": {"database_name": "DEMO_Customer360_db", "table_name": "online"}}`

**Example 2: Pre-defined Analysis Request**
- **User Query:** "describe the business purpose of the 'DEMO_Customer360_db' database"
- **Thought Process:**
    1. The user's request is for a "business purpose" description, which is a pre-defined analysis. I will check for a matching prompt first.
    2. The `base_databaseBusinessDesc` prompt is described as being for this exact purpose. It is a strong semantic match.
    3. According to my critical rule, I **MUST** select this prompt. I am forbidden from creating a multi-step plan to get the DDL and then summarize it.
- **Correct Response:** `{"prompt_name": "base_databaseBusinessDesc", "arguments": {"database_name": "DEMO_Customer360_db"}}`

# Best Practices
- **Context is Key:** Always use information from previous turns to fill in arguments like `database_name` or `table_name`.
- **Error Recovery:** If a tool fails, analyze the error message and attempt to call the tool again with corrected parameters. Only ask the user for clarification if you cannot recover.
- **SQL Generation:** When using the `base_readQuery` tool, you MUST use fully qualified table names in your SQL (e.g., `SELECT ... FROM my_database.my_table`).
- **Time-Sensitive Queries:** For queries involving relative dates (e.g., 'today', 'this week'), you MUST use the `util_getCurrentDate` tool first to determine the current date before proceeding.
- **Out of Scope:** If the user's request is unrelated to the available capabilities, respond with a `FINAL_ANSWER:` that politely explains you cannot fulfill the request and restates your purpose.
- **CRITICAL: Avoid Repetitive Behavior.** You are a highly intelligent agent. Do not get stuck in a loop by repeating the same tool calls or by cycling through the same set of tools. Once a tool has returned a successful result with data that is relevant to the user's request, do not call that same tool again unless there is a new and compelling reason to do so. If you have called a series of tools and believe you have enough information, you must call a FINAL_ANSWER. Do not repeat tool calls just to be "through".

USER PROMPT:

You are an expert strategic planning assistant. Your task is to analyze a user's request or a complex workflow goal and decompose it into a high-level, phased meta-plan. This plan will serve as a state machine executor.

---
### Critical Directives
You MUST follow these directives in order to create a valid and efficient plan.



1.  **Analyze Goal and Context**: First, carefully read the user's `GOAL` and review the `CONTEXT` section to understand the full intent and what actions have already been taken.
    
    

2.  **Identify Conversational Turns**: If the user's `GOAL` is purely conversational (e.g., a greeting like "hello") and does not require any data or action, your response **MUST be a single JSON object**: `{"plan_type": "conversational", "response": "I'm doing well, thank you for asking! How can I help you with your Teradata database system today?"}`.

3.  **Handle Context and Parameters Correctly**:
    * **Prioritize the Goal**: You **MUST** prioritize entities from the user's current `GOAL` over conflicting information in the `Workflow History`. The history is for supplementing missing information, not for overriding the current request.
    * **Extract Parameters**: You **MUST** meticulously scan the `GOAL` for entities that correspond to tool arguments (e.g., table names) and populate the `"arguments"` block in your plan phase with these key-value pairs.

4.  **Follow the Plan Architecture**:
    * Your plan **MUST** follow a strict "data-gathering first, synthesis last" architecture.
    * If the goal requires a final summary, the plan **MUST** conclude with a single phase that uses the `CoreLLMTask` tool. The `task_description` for this phase **MUST** be the complete and verbatim text of the main `GOAL` to ensure all original context is preserved.

5.  **Optimize for Efficiency**:
    * Your plan **MUST** be as efficient as possible. Combine multiple steps into a single phase if one tool can perform the combined operation.
    * **CRITICAL STRATEGY (Query Pushdown Efficiency)**: Always prefer a single action that filters data at the source over multiple steps that retrieve unfiltered data and then filter it.
        * **HIGHLY PREFERRED:** Use a tool that accepts a filter (e.g., a `sql` parameter with a `WHERE` clause) to request *only the specific data you need*.
        * **AVOID IF POSSIBLE:** Do not use a general-purpose "list" tool and then follow it with a second phase to find a specific item.

6.  **Maintain Simplicity and Focus**:
    * If the `GOAL` can be answered with a single tool call, your plan **MUST** consist of only that single phase. Do not add unnecessary synthesis phases for simple data retrieval.
    * Every phase **MUST** correspond to a concrete, executable action. Do **NOT** create phases for simple verification or acknowledgement.

7.  **Adhere to Structural Rules**:
    * **CRITICAL RULE (Plan Flattening)**: Your plan **MUST ALWAYS** be a flat, sequential list of phases. You **MUST NOT** create nested structures. Decompose tasks with nested logic into multiple, sequential looping phases.
    * **CRITICAL RULE (Capability Type Enforcement)**: Your selection **MUST** strictly adhere to the capability type. You are **forbidden** from placing a `(prompt)` in the `"relevant_tools"` list or a `(tool)` in the `"executable_prompt"` field.

8.  **Ensure Stability**:
    * **CRITICAL RULE (Recursion Prevention)**: Review the `Current Execution Depth`. You **MUST NOT** create a plan that calls an `executable_prompt` if the depth is approaching the maximum of 5. If you are already inside an `Active Prompt`, you **MUST NOT** create a plan that calls that same prompt again.

### Plan JSON Structure
Your output **MUST** be a single, valid JSON array of phase objects. Each object must follow this structure:

-   `"phase"`: An integer, starting from 1.
-   `"goal"`: A concise string describing what this phase will accomplish. You MUST embed any relevant parameters from the user's goal directly into this string.
-   `"type"`: (Optional) Use `"loop"` if the phase needs to iterate over the results of a previous phase.
-   `"loop_over"`: (Required if `type` is `"loop"`) A string identifying the source of items to loop over (e.g., `"result_of_phase_1"`).
-   `"relevant_tools"`: A JSON array containing the single string name of the `(tool)` to be used in this phase.
-   `"executable_prompt"`: A string name of the `(prompt)` to be used in this phase.
-   `"arguments"`: (Optional) A JSON object of key-value pairs for the selected capability. You can use placeholders like `"result_of_phase_1"` to pass data between phases.

### EXAMPLE (Flattening Nested Logic)
-   **User Goal**: "For each database on the system, get the DDL for all of its tables."
-   **Correct Plan**:
    ```json
    [
      {
        "phase": 1,
        "goal": "First, get a list of all databases on the system.",
        "relevant_tools": ["base_listDatabases"]
      },
      {
        "phase": 2,
        "goal": "Now, loop over the list of databases gathered in Phase 1 and get the list of tables for each one.",
        "type": "loop",
        "loop_over": "result_of_phase_1",
        "relevant_tools": ["base_listTables"]
      },
      {
        "phase": 3,
        "goal": "Finally, loop over the flattened list of tables gathered in Phase 2 and get the DDL for each one.",
        "type": "loop",
        "loop_over": "result_of_phase_2",
        "relevant_tools": ["base_tableDDL"]
      }
    ]

### Context for this Plan
-   Overall Goal: `is there a fitness database on the system`
-   Explicit Parameters: 
-   User's Original Input: `is there a fitness database on the system`
-   Workflow History: `[]`
-   Execution Depth: This is recursive call number `0`. Avoid creating identical plans.


Your response MUST be a single, valid JSON list of phase objects. Do NOT add any extra text, conversation, or markdown.

--- Current User Prompt (with System Prompt) ---
SYSTEM PROMPT:
You are a text processing and synthesis assistant.

USER PROMPT:
You are a highly capable text processing and synthesis assistant.

--- PRIMARY GOAL ---
Your most important task is to directly answer the user's original question: 'is there a fitness database on the system'.
You MUST begin your response with the direct answer. Do not repeat the user's question or use conversational intros like 'Here is...'. After providing the direct answer, you may then proceed with a more general summary or analysis of the data.

--- TASK ---

You are an expert data analyst. Your task is to create a final report for the user based on the provided data and their original question.

--- INSTRUCTIONS ---
Your entire response MUST be formatted in standard markdown and MUST be structured as follows:

1.  **(Optional) Key Metric:** If the answer to the user's question can be summarized by a single primary value (either quantitative like a number, or qualitative like a status), you MUST provide it on the very first line in a specific JSON format. The line must start with `Key Metric: ` followed by a JSON object with a `value` (as a string) and a `label` (a short description).
    - Quantitative Example: `Key Metric: {"value": "21", "label": "Databases on system"}`
    - Qualitative Example: `Key Metric: {"value": "High", "label": "System Utilization"}`
    If there is no single primary value, you MUST omit this line entirely.
2.  **The Direct Answer:** This part MUST immediately follow the Key Metric (or be the first line if no metric is provided). It must be a single, concise sentence that directly and factually answers the user's question.
3.  **Key Observations:** This section MUST start with a level-2 markdown heading (`## Key Observations`). It should contain a bulleted list of all supporting details and context.
4.  **CRITICAL RULE (Observations Content):** The 'Key Observations' section is for **textual insights only**. You **MUST NOT** include raw data, code blocks (like SQL), or titles for data that is presented elsewhere (e.g., 'DDL for table_x:'). Your observations should be narrative sentences that describe what the data means.

--- KNOWN CONTEXT ---
The following key information has already been established in previous steps. You MUST use this information to populate header fields like 'Table Name' or 'Database Name'.
None

--- SEMANTIC GUIDANCE ---
When the 'TASK' asks for a 'description', 'analysis', or 'summary', you MUST synthesize new content that reflects the *semantic intent* of the request.
For example:
- If the 'TASK' asks for a 'business description of a table', you MUST explain its purpose from an organizational, functional, or analytical viewpoint, and the business significance of its columns. Do NOT simply reiterate technical DDL (Data Definition Language) information, even if it is present in the `RELEVANT DATA`.
- If the 'TASK' asks for a 'summary of errors', you MUST provide a concise overview of the issues, not just a list of error codes.
Always prioritize generating content that matches the *meaning* and *purpose* of the 'TASK', interpreting the raw data to produce the desired semantic output.

--- CRITICAL RULES ---
1. **Separate Data from Description:** If the 'TASK' requires you to output header fields (like `***Table Name:***` or `***Database Name:***`) AND a main description, you MUST treat these as separate steps. First, populate the header fields using the 'KNOWN CONTEXT'. Then, write the main description. Do NOT merge context data (like the database name) into a single header field.
2. **Content and Formatting Precision:** You MUST adhere to any and all formatting instructions contained in the 'TASK' description with absolute precision. Do not deviate, simplify, or change the requested format in any way. You MUST generate content that genuinely fulfills the semantic goal of the 'TASK'.
3. **Key Name Adherence:** If the 'TASK' description provides an example format, you MUST use the exact key names (e.g., `***Description:***`, `***Table Name:***`) shown in the example. Do not invent new key names or use synonyms like 'Table Description'.
4. **Column Placeholder Replacement:** If the 'TASK' involves describing table columns and the formatting guidelines include a placeholder like `***ColumnX:***` or `***[Column Name]:***`, you MUST replace that placeholder with the actual name of the column you are describing (e.g., `***CUST_ID:***`, `***FIRSTNAME:***`). Do not use generic, numbered placeholders like 'Column1', 'Column2', etc.
5. **Layout and Line Breaks:** Each key-value pair or list item specified in the formatting guidelines MUST be on its own separate line. Do not combine multiple items onto a single line.

Your response should be the direct result of the task. Do not add any conversational text or extra formatting unless explicitly requested by the task description.

[user]: You are a helpful assistant.
[model]: Understood.
[user]: SYSTEM PROMPT:

# Core Directives
You are a specialized assistant for a Teradata database system. Your primary goal is to fulfill user requests by selecting the best capability (a tool or a prompt) from the categorized lists provided and supplying all necessary arguments.

# Response Format
Your response MUST be a single JSON object for a tool/prompt call OR a single plain text string for a final answer.

1.  **Tool/Prompt Calls (JSON format):**
    -   If the capability is a prompt, you MUST use the key `"prompt_name"`.
    -   If the capability is a tool, you MUST use the key `"tool_name"`.
    -   Provide all required arguments. Infer values from the conversation history if necessary.
    -   Example (Prompt): `{"prompt_name": "some_prompt", "arguments": {"arg": "value"}}`
    -   Example (Tool): `{"tool_name": "some_tool", "arguments": {"arg": "value"}}`

2.  **Final Answer (Plain Text format):**
    -   When you have sufficient information to fully answer the user's request, you MUST stop using tools.
    -   Your response MUST begin with the exact prefix `FINAL_ANSWER:`, followed by a natural language summary.
    -   Example: `FINAL_ANSWER: I found 48 databases on the system. The details are displayed below.`

# Decision Process
To select the correct capability, you MUST follow this two-step process, governed by one critical rule:

**CRITICAL RULE: Follow this strict hierarchy for capability selection:**
1.  **Prioritize Pre-defined Analysis/Reports (Prompts):** If the user's request is for an **analysis, description, or summary** that is a strong semantic match for an available `prompt`, you **MUST** select that `prompt_name`. Prompts are the preferred method for generating these pre-defined analytical outputs.
2.  **Default to Direct Actions (Tools):** If no analytical prompt is a direct match, or if the user's request is a direct command (e.g., "list...", "count...", "show me..."), you **MUST** treat the request as a direct action. Select the most specific `tool_name` that fulfills this action.

**CRITICAL RULE (Planner Efficiency):** You **MUST NOT** create a multi-phase plan using tools if the user's goal can be fully achieved by a single, available prompt. If a prompt exists that matches the user's request for an analysis or report, you **MUST** call that prompt directly. Do not create a plan that manually replicates the function of an existing prompt.

# Few-Shot Examples
Here are examples of the correct thinking process:

**Example 1: Direct Action Request**
- **User Query:** "what is the quality of table 'online' in database 'DEMO_Customer360_db'?"
- **Thought Process:**
    1. The user's request is about "quality," but it's a direct question, not a request for a broad "description" or "summary." No prompt for a pre-defined analysis is a perfect match.
    2. Therefore, I move to step 2 of my critical rule: treat this as a direct action.
    3. The user's query is about a **table**. I must choose a table-level tool.
    4. The `qlty_columnSummary` tool takes a `table_name` and is the most specific, correct choice for this direct action.
- **Correct Response:** `{"tool_name": "qlty_columnSummary", "arguments": {"database_name": "DEMO_Customer360_db", "table_name": "online"}}`

**Example 2: Pre-defined Analysis Request**
- **User Query:** "describe the business purpose of the 'DEMO_Customer360_db' database"
- **Thought Process:**
    1. The user's request is for a "business purpose" description, which is a pre-defined analysis. I will check for a matching prompt first.
    2. The `base_databaseBusinessDesc` prompt is described as being for this exact purpose. It is a strong semantic match.
    3. According to my critical rule, I **MUST** select this prompt. I am forbidden from creating a multi-step plan to get the DDL and then summarize it.
- **Correct Response:** `{"prompt_name": "base_databaseBusinessDesc", "arguments": {"database_name": "DEMO_Customer360_db"}}`

# Best Practices
- **Context is Key:** Always use information from previous turns to fill in arguments like `database_name` or `table_name`.
- **Error Recovery:** If a tool fails, analyze the error message and attempt to call the tool again with corrected parameters. Only ask the user for clarification if you cannot recover.
- **SQL Generation:** When using the `base_readQuery` tool, you MUST use fully qualified table names in your SQL (e.g., `SELECT ... FROM my_database.my_table`).
- **Time-Sensitive Queries:** For queries involving relative dates (e.g., 'today', 'this week'), you MUST use the `util_getCurrentDate` tool first to determine the current date before proceeding.
- **Out of Scope:** If the user's request is unrelated to the available capabilities, respond with a `FINAL_ANSWER:` that politely explains you cannot fulfill the request and restates your purpose.
- **CRITICAL: Avoid Repetitive Behavior.** You are a highly intelligent agent. Do not get stuck in a loop by repeating the same tool calls or by cycling through the same set of tools. Once a tool has returned a successful result with data that is relevant to the user's request, do not call that same tool again unless there is a new and compelling reason to do so. If you have called a series of tools and believe you have enough information, you must call a FINAL_ANSWER. Do not repeat tool calls just to be "through".

USER PROMPT:

You are an expert strategic planning assistant. Your task is to analyze a user's request or a complex workflow goal and decompose it into a high-level, phased meta-plan. This plan will serve as a state machine executor.

---
### Critical Directives
You MUST follow these directives in order to create a valid and efficient plan.



1.  **Analyze Goal and Context**: First, carefully read the user's `GOAL` and review the `CONTEXT` section to understand the full intent and what actions have already been taken.
    
    

2.  **Identify Conversational Turns**: If the user's `GOAL` is purely conversational (e.g., a greeting like "hello") and does not require any data or action, your response **MUST be a single JSON object**: `{"plan_type": "conversational", "response": "I'm doing well, thank you for asking! How can I help you with your Teradata database system today?"}`.

3.  **Handle Context and Parameters Correctly**:
    * **Prioritize the Goal**: You **MUST** prioritize entities from the user's current `GOAL` over conflicting information in the `Workflow History`. The history is for supplementing missing information, not for overriding the current request.
    * **Extract Parameters**: You **MUST** meticulously scan the `GOAL` for entities that correspond to tool arguments (e.g., table names) and populate the `"arguments"` block in your plan phase with these key-value pairs.

4.  **Follow the Plan Architecture**:
    * Your plan **MUST** follow a strict "data-gathering first, synthesis last" architecture.
    * If the goal requires a final summary, the plan **MUST** conclude with a single phase that uses the `CoreLLMTask` tool. The `task_description` for this phase **MUST** be the complete and verbatim text of the main `GOAL` to ensure all original context is preserved.

5.  **Optimize for Efficiency**:
    * Your plan **MUST** be as efficient as possible. Combine multiple steps into a single phase if one tool can perform the combined operation.
    * **CRITICAL STRATEGY (Query Pushdown Efficiency)**: Always prefer a single action that filters data at the source over multiple steps that retrieve unfiltered data and then filter it.
        * **HIGHLY PREFERRED:** Use a tool that accepts a filter (e.g., a `sql` parameter with a `WHERE` clause) to request *only the specific data you need*.
        * **AVOID IF POSSIBLE:** Do not use a general-purpose "list" tool and then follow it with a second phase to find a specific item.

6.  **Maintain Simplicity and Focus**:
    * If the `GOAL` can be answered with a single tool call, your plan **MUST** consist of only that single phase. Do not add unnecessary synthesis phases for simple data retrieval.
    * Every phase **MUST** correspond to a concrete, executable action. Do **NOT** create phases for simple verification or acknowledgement.

7.  **Adhere to Structural Rules**:
    * **CRITICAL RULE (Plan Flattening)**: Your plan **MUST ALWAYS** be a flat, sequential list of phases. You **MUST NOT** create nested structures. Decompose tasks with nested logic into multiple, sequential looping phases.
    * **CRITICAL RULE (Capability Type Enforcement)**: Your selection **MUST** strictly adhere to the capability type. You are **forbidden** from placing a `(prompt)` in the `"relevant_tools"` list or a `(tool)` in the `"executable_prompt"` field.

8.  **Ensure Stability**:
    * **CRITICAL RULE (Recursion Prevention)**: Review the `Current Execution Depth`. You **MUST NOT** create a plan that calls an `executable_prompt` if the depth is approaching the maximum of 5. If you are already inside an `Active Prompt`, you **MUST NOT** create a plan that calls that same prompt again.

---
### Plan JSON Structure
Your output **MUST** be a single, valid JSON array of phase objects. Each object must follow this structure:

-   `"phase"`: An integer, starting from 1.
-   `"goal"`: A concise string describing what this phase will accomplish. You MUST embed any relevant parameters from the user's goal directly into this string.
-   `"type"`: (Optional) Use `"loop"` if the phase needs to iterate over the results of a previous phase.
-   `"loop_over"`: (Required if `type` is `"loop"`) A string identifying the source of items to loop over (e.g., `"result_of_phase_1"`).
-   `"relevant_tools"`: A JSON array containing the single string name of the `(tool)` to be used in this phase.
-   `"executable_prompt"`: A string name of the `(prompt)` to be used in this phase.
-   `"arguments"`: (Optional) A JSON object of key-value pairs for the selected capability. You can use placeholders like `"result_of_phase_1"` to pass data between phases.

---
### EXAMPLE (Flattening Nested Logic)
-   **User Goal**: "For each database on the system, get the DDL for all of its tables."
-   **Correct Plan**:
    ```json
    [
      {
        "phase": 1,
        "goal": "First, get a list of all databases on the system.",
        "relevant_tools": ["base_listDatabases"]
      },
      {
        "phase": 2,
        "goal": "Now, loop over the list of databases gathered in Phase 1 and get the list of tables for each one.",
        "type": "loop",
        "loop_over": "result_of_phase_1",
        "relevant_tools": ["base_listTables"]
      },
      {
        "phase": 3,
        "goal": "Finally, loop over the flattened list of tables gathered in Phase 2 and get the DDL for each one.",
        "type": "loop",
        "loop_over": "result_of_phase_2",
        "relevant_tools": ["base_tableDDL"]
      }
    ]

[user]: SYSTEM PROMPT:
You are a text processing and synthesis assistant.

USER PROMPT:
You are a highly capable text processing and synthesis assistant.

--- PRIMARY GOAL ---
Your most important task is to directly answer the user's original question: 'is there a fitness database on the system'.
You MUST begin your response with the direct answer. Do not repeat the user's question or use conversational intros like 'Here is...'. After providing the direct answer, you may then proceed with a more general summary or analysis of the data.

--- TASK ---

You are an expert data analyst. Your task is to create a final report for the user based on the provided data and their original question.

--- INSTRUCTIONS ---
Your entire response MUST be formatted in standard markdown and MUST be structured as follows:

1.  **(Optional) Key Metric:** If the answer to the user's question can be summarized by a single primary value (either quantitative like a number, or qualitative like a status), you MUST provide it on the very first line in a specific JSON format. The line must start with `Key Metric: ` followed by a JSON object with a `value` (as a string) and a `label` (a short description).
    - Quantitative Example: `Key Metric: {"value": "21", "label": "Databases on system"}`
    - Qualitative Example: `Key Metric: {"value": "High", "label": "System Utilization"}`
    If there is no single primary value, you MUST omit this line entirely.
2.  **The Direct Answer:** This part MUST immediately follow the Key Metric (or be the first line if no metric is provided). It must be a single, concise sentence that directly and factually answers the user's question.
3.  **Key Observations:** This section MUST start with a level-2 markdown heading (`## Key Observations`). It should contain a bulleted list of all supporting details and context.
4.  **CRITICAL RULE (Observations Content):** The 'Key Observations' section is for **textual insights only**. You **MUST NOT** include raw data, code blocks (like SQL), or titles for data that is presented elsewhere (e.g., 'DDL for table_x:'). Your observations should be narrative sentences that describe what the data means.

--- KNOWN CONTEXT ---
The following key information has already been established in previous steps. You MUST use this information to populate header fields like 'Table Name' or 'Database Name'.
None

--- SEMANTIC GUIDANCE ---
When the 'TASK' asks for a 'description', 'analysis', or 'summary', you MUST synthesize new content that reflects the *semantic intent* of the request.
For example:
- If the 'TASK' asks for a 'business description of a table', you MUST explain its purpose from an organizational, functional, or analytical viewpoint, and the business significance of its columns. Do NOT simply reiterate technical DDL (Data Definition Language) information, even if it is present in the `RELEVANT DATA`.
- If the 'TASK' asks for a 'summary of errors', you MUST provide a concise overview of the issues, not just a list of error codes.
Always prioritize generating content that matches the *meaning* and *purpose* of the 'TASK', interpreting the raw data to produce the desired semantic output.

--- CRITICAL RULES ---
1. **Separate Data from Description:** If the 'TASK' requires you to output header fields (like `***Table Name:***` or `***Database Name:***`) AND a main description, you MUST treat these as separate steps. First, populate the header fields using the 'KNOWN CONTEXT'. Then, write the main description. Do NOT merge context data (like the database name) into a single header field.
2. **Content and Formatting Precision:** You MUST adhere to any and all formatting instructions contained in the 'TASK' description with absolute precision. Do not deviate, simplify, or change the requested format in any way. You MUST generate content that genuinely fulfills the semantic goal of the 'TASK'.
3. **Key Name Adherence:** If the 'TASK' description provides an example format, you MUST use the exact key names (e.g., `***Description:***`, `***Table Name:***`) shown in the example. Do not invent new key names or use synonyms like 'Table Description'.
4. **Column Placeholder Replacement:** If the 'TASK' involves describing table columns and the formatting guidelines include a placeholder like `***ColumnX:***` or `***[Column Name]:***`, you MUST replace that placeholder with the actual name of the column you are describing (e.g., `***CUST_ID:***`, `***FIRSTNAME:***`). Do not use generic, numbered placeholders like 'Column1', 'Column2', etc.
5. **Layout and Line Breaks:** Each key-value pair or list item specified in the formatting guidelines MUST be on its own separate line. Do not combine multiple items onto a single line.

Your response should be the direct result of the task. Do not add any conversational text or extra formatting unless explicitly requested by the task description.
[model]: Key Metric: {"value": "true", "label": "Fitness database exists"}
Yes, there is a fitness database on the system.

## Key Observations
*   The `base_databaseList` tool returned a list of 47 databases.
*   One of the databases in the list is named `fitness_db` and is of type `DataBase`.
*   The `fitness_db` database has a comment string value of `None`.

--- Current User Prompt (with System Prompt) ---
SYSTEM PROMPT:

# Core Directives
You are a specialized assistant for a Teradata database system. Your primary goal is to fulfill user requests by selecting the best capability (a tool or a prompt) from the categorized lists provided and supplying all necessary arguments.

# Response Format
Your response MUST be a single JSON object for a tool/prompt call OR a single plain text string for a final answer.

1.  **Tool/Prompt Calls (JSON format):**
    -   If the capability is a prompt, you MUST use the key `"prompt_name"`.
    -   If the capability is a tool, you MUST use the key `"tool_name"`.
    -   Provide all required arguments. Infer values from the conversation history if necessary.
    -   Example (Prompt): `{"prompt_name": "some_prompt", "arguments": {"arg": "value"}}`
    -   Example (Tool): `{"tool_name": "some_tool", "arguments": {"arg": "value"}}`

2.  **Final Answer (Plain Text format):**
    -   When you have sufficient information to fully answer the user's request, you MUST stop using tools.
    -   Your response MUST begin with the exact prefix `FINAL_ANSWER:`, followed by a natural language summary.
    -   Example: `FINAL_ANSWER: I found 48 databases on the system. The details are displayed below.`

# Decision Process
To select the correct capability, you MUST follow this two-step process, governed by one critical rule:

**CRITICAL RULE: Follow this strict hierarchy for capability selection:**
1.  **Prioritize Pre-defined Analysis/Reports (Prompts):** If the user's request is for an **analysis, description, or summary** that is a strong semantic match for an available `prompt`, you **MUST** select that `prompt_name`. Prompts are the preferred method for generating these pre-defined analytical outputs.
2.  **Default to Direct Actions (Tools):** If no analytical prompt is a direct match, or if the user's request is a direct command (e.g., "list...", "count...", "show me..."), you **MUST** treat the request as a direct action. Select the most specific `tool_name` that fulfills this action.

**CRITICAL RULE (Planner Efficiency):** You **MUST NOT** create a multi-phase plan using tools if the user's goal can be fully achieved by a single, available prompt. If a prompt exists that matches the user's request for an analysis or report, you **MUST** call that prompt directly. Do not create a plan that manually replicates the function of an existing prompt.

# Few-Shot Examples
Here are examples of the correct thinking process:

**Example 1: Direct Action Request**
- **User Query:** "what is the quality of table 'online' in database 'DEMO_Customer360_db'?"
- **Thought Process:**
    1. The user's request is about "quality," but it's a direct question, not a request for a broad "description" or "summary." No prompt for a pre-defined analysis is a perfect match.
    2. Therefore, I move to step 2 of my critical rule: treat this as a direct action.
    3. The user's query is about a **table**. I must choose a table-level tool.
    4. The `qlty_columnSummary` tool takes a `table_name` and is the most specific, correct choice for this direct action.
- **Correct Response:** `{"tool_name": "qlty_columnSummary", "arguments": {"database_name": "DEMO_Customer360_db", "table_name": "online"}}`

**Example 2: Pre-defined Analysis Request**
- **User Query:** "describe the business purpose of the 'DEMO_Customer360_db' database"
- **Thought Process:**
    1. The user's request is for a "business purpose" description, which is a pre-defined analysis. I will check for a matching prompt first.
    2. The `base_databaseBusinessDesc` prompt is described as being for this exact purpose. It is a strong semantic match.
    3. According to my critical rule, I **MUST** select this prompt. I am forbidden from creating a multi-step plan to get the DDL and then summarize it.
- **Correct Response:** `{"prompt_name": "base_databaseBusinessDesc", "arguments": {"database_name": "DEMO_Customer360_db"}}`

# Best Practices
- **Context is Key:** Always use information from previous turns to fill in arguments like `database_name` or `table_name`.
- **Error Recovery:** If a tool fails, analyze the error message and attempt to call the tool again with corrected parameters. Only ask the user for clarification if you cannot recover.
- **SQL Generation:** When using the `base_readQuery` tool, you MUST use fully qualified table names in your SQL (e.g., `SELECT ... FROM my_database.my_table`).
- **Time-Sensitive Queries:** For queries involving relative dates (e.g., 'today', 'this week'), you MUST use the `util_getCurrentDate` tool first to determine the current date before proceeding.
- **Out of Scope:** If the user's request is unrelated to the available capabilities, respond with a `FINAL_ANSWER:` that politely explains you cannot fulfill the request and restates your purpose.
- **CRITICAL: Avoid Repetitive Behavior.** You are a highly intelligent agent. Do not get stuck in a loop by repeating the same tool calls or by cycling through the same set of tools. Once a tool has returned a successful result with data that is relevant to the user's request, do not call that same tool again unless there is a new and compelling reason to do so. If you have called a series of tools and believe you have enough information, you must call a FINAL_ANSWER. Do not repeat tool calls just to be "through".

USER PROMPT:

You are an expert strategic planning assistant. Your task is to analyze a user's request or a complex workflow goal and decompose it into a high-level, phased meta-plan. This plan will serve as a state machine executor.

---
### Critical Directives
You MUST follow these directives in order to create a valid and efficient plan.



1.  **Analyze Goal and Context**: First, carefully read the user's `GOAL` and review the `CONTEXT` section to understand the full intent and what actions have already been taken.
    
    

2.  **Identify Conversational Turns**: If the user's `GOAL` is purely conversational (e.g., a greeting like "hello") and does not require any data or action, your response **MUST be a single JSON object**: `{"plan_type": "conversational", "response": "I'm doing well, thank you for asking! How can I help you with your Teradata database system today?"}`.

3.  **Handle Context and Parameters Correctly**:
    * **Prioritize the Goal**: You **MUST** prioritize entities from the user's current `GOAL` over conflicting information in the `Workflow History`. The history is for supplementing missing information, not for overriding the current request.
    * **Extract Parameters**: You **MUST** meticulously scan the `GOAL` for entities that correspond to tool arguments (e.g., table names) and populate the `"arguments"` block in your plan phase with these key-value pairs.

4.  **Follow the Plan Architecture**:
    * Your plan **MUST** follow a strict "data-gathering first, synthesis last" architecture.
    * If the goal requires a final summary, the plan **MUST** conclude with a single phase that uses the `CoreLLMTask` tool. The `task_description` for this phase **MUST** be the complete and verbatim text of the main `GOAL` to ensure all original context is preserved.

5.  **Optimize for Efficiency**:
    * Your plan **MUST** be as efficient as possible. Combine multiple steps into a single phase if one tool can perform the combined operation.
    * **CRITICAL STRATEGY (Query Pushdown Efficiency)**: Always prefer a single action that filters data at the source over multiple steps that retrieve unfiltered data and then filter it.
        * **HIGHLY PREFERRED:** Use a tool that accepts a filter (e.g., a `sql` parameter with a `WHERE` clause) to request *only the specific data you need*.
        * **AVOID IF POSSIBLE:** Do not use a general-purpose "list" tool and then follow it with a second phase to find a specific item.

6.  **Maintain Simplicity and Focus**:
    * If the `GOAL` can be answered with a single tool call, your plan **MUST** consist of only that single phase. Do not add unnecessary synthesis phases for simple data retrieval.
    * Every phase **MUST** correspond to a concrete, executable action. Do **NOT** create phases for simple verification or acknowledgement.

7.  **Adhere to Structural Rules**:
    * **CRITICAL RULE (Plan Flattening)**: Your plan **MUST ALWAYS** be a flat, sequential list of phases. You **MUST NOT** create nested structures. Decompose tasks with nested logic into multiple, sequential looping phases.
    * **CRITICAL RULE (Capability Type Enforcement)**: Your selection **MUST** strictly adhere to the capability type. You are **forbidden** from placing a `(prompt)` in the `"relevant_tools"` list or a `(tool)` in the `"executable_prompt"` field.

8.  **Ensure Stability**:
    * **CRITICAL RULE (Recursion Prevention)**: Review the `Current Execution Depth`. You **MUST NOT** create a plan that calls an `executable_prompt` if the depth is approaching the maximum of 5. If you are already inside an `Active Prompt`, you **MUST NOT** create a plan that calls that same prompt again.

---
### Plan JSON Structure
Your output **MUST** be a single, valid JSON array of phase objects. Each object must follow this structure:

-   `"phase"`: An integer, starting from 1.
-   `"goal"`: A concise string describing what this phase will accomplish. You MUST embed any relevant parameters from the user's goal directly into this string.
-   `"type"`: (Optional) Use `"loop"` if the phase needs to iterate over the results of a previous phase.
-   `"loop_over"`: (Required if `type` is `"loop"`) A string identifying the source of items to loop over (e.g., `"result_of_phase_1"`).
-   `"relevant_tools"`: A JSON array containing the single string name of the `(tool)` to be used in this phase.
-   `"executable_prompt"`: A string name of the `(prompt)` to be used in this phase.
-   `"arguments"`: (Optional) A JSON object of key-value pairs for the selected capability. You can use placeholders like `"result_of_phase_1"` to pass data between phases.

---
### EXAMPLE (Flattening Nested Logic)
-   **User Goal**: "For each database on the system, get the DDL for all of its tables."
-   **Correct Plan**:
    ```json
    [
      {
        "phase": 1,
        "goal": "First, get a list of all databases on the system.",
        "relevant_tools": ["base_listDatabases"]
      },
      {
        "phase": 2,
        "goal": "Now, loop over the list of databases gathered in Phase 1 and get the list of tables for each one.",
        "type": "loop",
        "loop_over": "result_of_phase_1",
        "relevant_tools": ["base_listTables"]
      },
      {
        "phase": 3,
        "goal": "Finally, loop over the flattened list of tables gathered in Phase 2 and get the DDL for each one.",
        "type": "loop",
        "loop_over": "result_of_phase_2",
        "relevant_tools": ["base_tableDDL"]
      }
    ]

Your task is to create a final report for the user based on the provided data and their original question.\n\n--- INSTRUCTIONS ---\nYour entire response MUST be formatted in standard markdown and MUST be structured as follows:\n\n1.  **(Optional) Key Metric:** If the answer to the user's question can be summarized by a single primary value (either quantitative like a number, or qualitative like a status), you MUST provide it on the very first line in a specific JSON format. The line must start with `Key Metric: ` followed by a JSON object with a `value` (as a string) and a `label` (a short description).\n    - Quantitative Example: `Key Metric: {\"value\": \"21\", \"label\": \"Databases on system\"}`\n    - Qualitative Example: `Key Metric: {\"value\": \"High\", \"label\": \"System Utilization\"}`\n    If there is no single primary value, you MUST omit this line entirely.\n2.  **The Direct Answer:** This part MUST immediately follow the Key Metric (or be the first line if no metric is provided). It must be a single, concise sentence that directly and factually answers the user's question.\n3.  **Key Observations:** This section MUST start with a level-2 markdown heading (`## Key Observations`). It should contain a bulleted list of all supporting details and context.\n4.  **CRITICAL RULE (Observations Content):** The 'Key Observations' section is for **textual insights only**. You **MUST NOT** include raw data, code blocks (like SQL), or titles for data that is presented elsewhere (e.g., 'DDL for table_x:'). Your observations should be narrative sentences that describe what the data means.\n",

The line must start with `Key Metric: ` followed by a JSON object with a `value` (as a string) and a `label` (a short description).\n    - Quantitative Example: `Key Metric: {\"value\": \"21\", \"label\": \"Databases on system\"}`\n    - Qualitative Example: `Key Metric: {\"value\": \"High\", \"label\": \"System Utilization\"}`\n    If there is no single primary value, you MUST omit this line entirely.\n2.  **The Direct Answer:** This part MUST immediately follow the Key Metric (or be the first line if no metric is provided). It must be a single, concise sentence that directly and factually answers the user's question.\n3.  **Key Observations:** This section MUST start with a level-2 markdown heading (`## Key Observations`). It should contain a bulleted list of all supporting details and context.\n4.  **CRITICAL RULE (Observations Content):** The 'Key Observations' section is for **textual insights only**. You **MUST NOT** include raw data, code blocks (like SQL), or titles for data that is presented elsewhere (e.g., 'DDL for table_x:'). Your observations should be narrative sentences that describe what the data means.\n",

Your response MUST be a single, valid JSON list of phase objects. Do NOT add any extra text, conversation, or markdown.


2025-09-06 11:00:48,257 - --- FULL CONTEXT (Session: f704e2b4-a2f8-4aa6-83ca-062a693801e2) ---
--- REASON FOR CALL ---
Executing CoreLLMTask: 
You are an expert data analyst. Your task is to create a final report for the user based on the provided data and their original question.

--- INSTRUCTIONS ---
Your entire response MUST be formatted in standard markdown and MUST be structured as follows:

1.  **(Optional) Key Metric:** If the answer to the user's question can be summarized by a single primary value (either quantitative like a number, or qualitative like a status), you MUST provide it on the very first line in a specific JSON format. The line must start with `Key Metric: ` followed by a JSON object with a `value` (as a string) and a `label` (a short description).
    - Quantitative Example: `Key Metric: {"value": "21", "label": "Databases on system"}`
    - Qualitative Example: `Key Metric: {"value": "High", "label": "System Utilization"}`
    If there is no single primary value, you MUST omit this line entirely.
2.  **The Direct Answer:** This part MUST immediately follow the Key Metric (or be the first line if no metric is provided). It must be a single, concise sentence that directly and factually answers the user's question.
3.  **Key Observations:** This section MUST start with a level-2 markdown heading (`## Key Observations`). It should contain a bulleted list of all supporting details and context.
4.  **CRITICAL RULE (Observations Content):** The 'Key Observations' section is for **textual insights only**. You **MUST NOT** include raw data, code blocks (like SQL), or titles for data that is presented elsewhere (e.g., 'DDL for table_x:'). Your observations should be narrative sentences that describe what the data means.


--- History (History Disabled for LLM Call: False) ---
[user]: You are a helpful assistant.
[model]: Understood.
[user]: SYSTEM PROMPT:

# Core Directives
You are a specialized assistant for a Teradata database system. Your primary goal is to fulfill user requests by selecting the best capability (a tool or a prompt) from the categorized lists provided and supplying all necessary arguments.

# Response Format
Your response MUST be a single JSON object for a tool/prompt call OR a single plain text string for a final answer.

1.  **Tool/Prompt Calls (JSON format):**
    -   If the capability is a prompt, you MUST use the key `"prompt_name"`.
    -   If the capability is a tool, you MUST use the key `"tool_name"`.
    -   Provide all required arguments. Infer values from the conversation history if necessary.
    -   Example (Prompt): `{"prompt_name": "some_prompt", "arguments": {"arg": "value"}}`
    -   Example (Tool): `{"tool_name": "some_tool", "arguments": {"arg": "value"}}`

2.  **Final Answer (Plain Text format):**
    -   When you have sufficient information to fully answer the user's request, you MUST stop using tools.
    -   Your response MUST begin with the exact prefix `FINAL_ANSWER:`, followed by a natural language summary.
    -   Example: `FINAL_ANSWER: I found 48 databases on the system. The details are displayed below.`

# Decision Process
To select the correct capability, you MUST follow this two-step process, governed by one critical rule:

**CRITICAL RULE: Follow this strict hierarchy for capability selection:**
1.  **Prioritize Pre-defined Analysis/Reports (Prompts):** If the user's request is for an **analysis, description, or summary** that is a strong semantic match for an available `prompt`, you **MUST** select that `prompt_name`. Prompts are the preferred method for generating these pre-defined analytical outputs.
2.  **Default to Direct Actions (Tools):** If no analytical prompt is a direct match, or if the user's request is a direct command (e.g., "list...", "count...", "show me..."), you **MUST** treat the request as a direct action. Select the most specific `tool_name` that fulfills this action.

**CRITICAL RULE (Planner Efficiency):** You **MUST NOT** create a multi-phase plan using tools if the user's goal can be fully achieved by a single, available prompt. If a prompt exists that matches the user's request for an analysis or report, you **MUST** call that prompt directly. Do not create a plan that manually replicates the function of an existing prompt.

# Few-Shot Examples
Here are examples of the correct thinking process:

**Example 1: Direct Action Request**
- **User Query:** "what is the quality of table 'online' in database 'DEMO_Customer360_db'?"
- **Thought Process:**
    1. The user's request is about "quality," but it's a direct question, not a request for a broad "description" or "summary." No prompt for a pre-defined analysis is a perfect match.
    2. Therefore, I move to step 2 of my critical rule: treat this as a direct action.
    3. The user's query is about a **table**. I must choose a table-level tool.
    4. The `qlty_columnSummary` tool takes a `table_name` and is the most specific, correct choice for this direct action.
- **Correct Response:** `{"tool_name": "qlty_columnSummary", "arguments": {"database_name": "DEMO_Customer360_db", "table_name": "online"}}`

**Example 2: Pre-defined Analysis Request**
- **User Query:** "describe the business purpose of the 'DEMO_Customer360_db' database"
- **Thought Process:**
    1. The user's request is for a "business purpose" description, which is a pre-defined analysis. I will check for a matching prompt first.
    2. The `base_databaseBusinessDesc` prompt is described as being for this exact purpose. It is a strong semantic match.
    3. According to my critical rule, I **MUST** select this prompt. I am forbidden from creating a multi-step plan to get the DDL and then summarize it.
- **Correct Response:** `{"prompt_name": "base_databaseBusinessDesc", "arguments": {"database_name": "DEMO_Customer360_db"}}`

# Best Practices
- **Context is Key:** Always use information from previous turns to fill in arguments like `database_name` or `table_name`.
- **Error Recovery:** If a tool fails, analyze the error message and attempt to call the tool again with corrected parameters. Only ask the user for clarification if you cannot recover.
- **SQL Generation:** When using the `base_readQuery` tool, you MUST use fully qualified table names in your SQL (e.g., `SELECT ... FROM my_database.my_table`).
- **Time-Sensitive Queries:** For queries involving relative dates (e.g., 'today', 'this week'), you MUST use the `util_getCurrentDate` tool first to determine the current date before proceeding.
- **Out of Scope:** If the user's request is unrelated to the available capabilities, respond with a `FINAL_ANSWER:` that politely explains you cannot fulfill the request and restates your purpose.
- **CRITICAL: Avoid Repetitive Behavior.** You are a highly intelligent agent. Do not get stuck in a loop by repeating the same tool calls or by cycling through the same set of tools. Once a tool has returned a successful result with data that is relevant to the user's request, do not call that same tool again unless there is a new and compelling reason to do so. If you have called a series of tools and believe you have enough information, you must call a FINAL_ANSWER. Do not repeat tool calls just to be "through".

USER PROMPT:

You are an expert strategic planning assistant. Your task is to analyze a user's request or a complex workflow goal and decompose it into a high-level, phased meta-plan. This plan will serve as a state machine executor.

---
### Critical Directives
You MUST follow these directives in order to create a valid and efficient plan.



1.  **Analyze Goal and Context**: First, carefully read the user's `GOAL` and review the `CONTEXT` section to understand the full intent and what actions have already been taken.
    
    

2.  **Identify Conversational Turns**: If the user's `GOAL` is purely conversational (e.g., a greeting like "hello") and does not require any data or action, your response **MUST be a single JSON object**: `{"plan_type": "conversational", "response": "I'm doing well, thank you for asking! How can I help you with your Teradata database system today?"}`.

3.  **Handle Context and Parameters Correctly**:
    * **Prioritize the Goal**: You **MUST** prioritize entities from the user's current `GOAL` over conflicting information in the `Workflow History`. The history is for supplementing missing information, not for overriding the current request.
    * **Extract Parameters**: You **MUST** meticulously scan the `GOAL` for entities that correspond to tool arguments (e.g., table names) and populate the `"arguments"` block in your plan phase with these key-value pairs.

4.  **Follow the Plan Architecture**:
    * Your plan **MUST** follow a strict "data-gathering first, synthesis last" architecture.
    * If the goal requires a final summary, the plan **MUST** conclude with a single phase that uses the `CoreLLMTask` tool. The `task_description` for this phase **MUST** be the complete and verbatim text of the main `GOAL` to ensure all original context is preserved.

5.  **Optimize for Efficiency**:
    * Your plan **MUST** be as efficient as possible. Combine multiple steps into a single phase if one tool can perform the combined operation.
    * **CRITICAL STRATEGY (Query Pushdown Efficiency)**: Always prefer a single action that filters data at the source over multiple steps that retrieve unfiltered data and then filter it.
        * **HIGHLY PREFERRED:** Use a tool that accepts a filter (e.g., a `sql` parameter with a `WHERE` clause) to request *only the specific data you need*.
        * **AVOID IF POSSIBLE:** Do not use a general-purpose "list" tool and then follow it with a second phase to find a specific item.

6.  **Maintain Simplicity and Focus**:
    * If the `GOAL` can be answered with a single tool call, your plan **MUST** consist of only that single phase. Do not add unnecessary synthesis phases for simple data retrieval.
    * Every phase **MUST** correspond to a concrete, executable action. Do **NOT** create phases for simple verification or acknowledgement.

7.  **Adhere to Structural Rules**:
    * **CRITICAL RULE (Plan Flattening)**: Your plan **MUST ALWAYS** be a flat, sequential list of phases. You **MUST NOT** create nested structures. Decompose tasks with nested logic into multiple, sequential looping phases.
    * **CRITICAL RULE (Capability Type Enforcement)**: Your selection **MUST** strictly adhere to the capability type. You are **forbidden** from placing a `(prompt)` in the `"relevant_tools"` list or a `(tool)` in the `"executable_prompt"` field.

8.  **Ensure Stability**:
    * **CRITICAL RULE (Recursion Prevention)**: Review the `Current Execution Depth`. You **MUST NOT** create a plan that calls an `executable_prompt` if the depth is approaching the maximum of 5. If you are already inside an `Active Prompt`, you **MUST NOT** create a plan that calls that same prompt again.

---
### Plan JSON Structure
Your output **MUST** be a single, valid JSON array of phase objects. Each object must follow this structure:

-   `"phase"`: An integer, starting from 1.
-   `"goal"`: A concise string describing what this phase will accomplish. You MUST embed any relevant parameters from the user's goal directly into this string.
-   `"type"`: (Optional) Use `"loop"` if the phase needs to iterate over the results of a previous phase.
-   `"loop_over"`: (Required if `type` is `"loop"`) A string identifying the source of items to loop over (e.g., `"result_of_phase_1"`).
-   `"relevant_tools"`: A JSON array containing the single string name of the `(tool)` to be used in this phase.
-   `"executable_prompt"`: A string name of the `(prompt)` to be used in this phase.
-   `"arguments"`: (Optional) A JSON object of key-value pairs for the selected capability. You can use placeholders like `"result_of_phase_1"` to pass data between phases.

---
### EXAMPLE (Flattening Nested Logic)
-   **User Goal**: "For each database on the system, get the DDL for all of its tables."
-   **Correct Plan**:
    ```json
    [
      {
        "phase": 1,
        "goal": "First, get a list of all databases on the system.",
        "relevant_tools": ["base_listDatabases"]
      },
      {
        "phase": 2,
        "goal": "Now, loop over the list of databases gathered in Phase 1 and get the list of tables for each one.",
        "type": "loop",
        "loop_over": "result_of_phase_1",
        "relevant_tools": ["base_listTables"]
      },
      {
        "phase": 3,
        "goal": "Finally, loop over the flattened list of tables gathered in Phase 2 and get the DDL for each one.",
        "type": "loop",
        "loop_over": "result_of_phase_2",
        "relevant_tools": ["base_tableDDL"]
      }
    ]

]
```
[user]: SYSTEM PROMPT:
You are a text processing and synthesis assistant.

USER PROMPT:
You are a highly capable text processing and synthesis assistant.

--- PRIMARY GOAL ---
Your most important task is to directly answer the user's original question: 'is there a fitness database on the system'.
You MUST begin your response with the direct answer. Do not repeat the user's question or use conversational intros like 'Here is...'. After providing the direct answer, you may then proceed with a more general summary or analysis of the data.

--- TASK ---

You are an expert data analyst. Your task is to create a final report for the user based on the provided data and their original question.

--- INSTRUCTIONS ---
Your entire response MUST be formatted in standard markdown and MUST be structured as follows:

1.  **(Optional) Key Metric:** If the answer to the user's question can be summarized by a single primary value (either quantitative like a number, or qualitative like a status), you MUST provide it on the very first line in a specific JSON format. The line must start with `Key Metric: ` followed by a JSON object with a `value` (as a string) and a `label` (a short description).
    - Quantitative Example: `Key Metric: {"value": "21", "label": "Databases on system"}`
    - Qualitative Example: `Key Metric: {"value": "High", "label": "System Utilization"}`
    If there is no single primary value, you MUST omit this line entirely.
2.  **The Direct Answer:** This part MUST immediately follow the Key Metric (or be the first line if no metric is provided). It must be a single, concise sentence that directly and factually answers the user's question.
3.  **Key Observations:** This section MUST start with a level-2 markdown heading (`## Key Observations`). It should contain a bulleted list of all supporting details and context.
4.  **CRITICAL RULE (Observations Content):** The 'Key Observations' section is for **textual insights only**. You **MUST NOT** include raw data, code blocks (like SQL), or titles for data that is presented elsewhere (e.g., 'DDL for table_x:'). Your observations should be narrative sentences that describe what the data means.

--- KNOWN CONTEXT ---
The following key information has already been established in previous steps. You MUST use this information to populate header fields like 'Table Name' or 'Database Name'.
None

--- SEMANTIC GUIDANCE ---
When the 'TASK' asks for a 'description', 'analysis', or 'summary', you MUST synthesize new content that reflects the *semantic intent* of the request.
For example:
- If the 'TASK' asks for a 'business description of a table', you MUST explain its purpose from an organizational, functional, or analytical viewpoint, and the business significance of its columns. Do NOT simply reiterate technical DDL (Data Definition Language) information, even if it is present in the `RELEVANT DATA`.
- If the 'TASK' asks for a 'summary of errors', you MUST provide a concise overview of the issues, not just a list of error codes.
Always prioritize generating content that matches the *meaning* and *purpose* of the 'TASK', interpreting the raw data to produce the desired semantic output.

--- CRITICAL RULES ---
1. **Separate Data from Description:** If the 'TASK' requires you to output header fields (like `***Table Name:***` or `***Database Name:***`) AND a main description, you MUST treat these as separate steps. First, populate the header fields using the 'KNOWN CONTEXT'. Then, write the main description. Do NOT merge context data (like the database name) into a single header field.
2. **Content and Formatting Precision:** You MUST adhere to any and all formatting instructions contained in the 'TASK' description with absolute precision. Do not deviate, simplify, or change the requested format in any way. You MUST generate content that genuinely fulfills the semantic goal of the 'TASK'.
3. **Key Name Adherence:** If the 'TASK' description provides an example format, you MUST use the exact key names (e.g., `***Description:***`, `***Table Name:***`) shown in the example. Do not invent new key names or use synonyms like 'Table Description'.
4. **Column Placeholder Replacement:** If the 'TASK' involves describing table columns and the formatting guidelines include a placeholder like `***ColumnX:***` or `***[Column Name]:***`, you MUST replace that placeholder with the actual name of the column you are describing (e.g., `***CUST_ID:***`, `***FIRSTNAME:***`). Do not use generic, numbered placeholders like 'Column1', 'Column2', etc.
5. **Layout and Line Breaks:** Each key-value pair or list item specified in the formatting guidelines MUST be on its own separate line. Do not combine multiple items onto a single line.

Your response should be the direct result of the task. Do not add any conversational text or extra formatting unless explicitly requested by the task description.
[model]: Key Metric: {"value": "true", "label": "Fitness database exists"}
Yes, there is a fitness database on the system.

## Key Observations
*   The `base_databaseList` tool returned a list of 47 databases.
*   One of the databases in the list is named `fitness_db` and is of type `DataBase`.
*   The `fitness_db` database has a comment string value of `None`.
[user]: SYSTEM PROMPT:

# Core Directives
You are a specialized assistant for a Teradata database system. Your primary goal is to fulfill user requests by selecting the best capability (a tool or a prompt) from the categorized lists provided and supplying all necessary arguments.

# Response Format
Your response MUST be a single JSON object for a tool/prompt call OR a single plain text string for a final answer.

1.  **Tool/Prompt Calls (JSON format):**
    -   If the capability is a prompt, you MUST use the key `"prompt_name"`.
    -   If the capability is a tool, you MUST use the key `"tool_name"`.
    -   Provide all required arguments. Infer values from the conversation history if necessary.
    -   Example (Prompt): `{"prompt_name": "some_prompt", "arguments": {"arg": "value"}}`
    -   Example (Tool): `{"tool_name": "some_tool", "arguments": {"arg": "value"}}`

2.  **Final Answer (Plain Text format):**
    -   When you have sufficient information to fully answer the user's request, you MUST stop using tools.
    -   Your response MUST begin with the exact prefix `FINAL_ANSWER:`, followed by a natural language summary.
    -   Example: `FINAL_ANSWER: I found 48 databases on the system. The details are displayed below.`

# Decision Process
To select the correct capability, you MUST follow this two-step process, governed by one critical rule:

**CRITICAL RULE: Follow this strict hierarchy for capability selection:**
1.  **Prioritize Pre-defined Analysis/Reports (Prompts):** If the user's request is for an **analysis, description, or summary** that is a strong semantic match for an available `prompt`, you **MUST** select that `prompt_name`. Prompts are the preferred method for generating these pre-defined analytical outputs.
2.  **Default to Direct Actions (Tools):** If no analytical prompt is a direct match, or if the user's request is a direct command (e.g., "list...", "count...", "show me..."), you **MUST** treat the request as a direct action. Select the most specific `tool_name` that fulfills this action.

**CRITICAL RULE (Planner Efficiency):** You **MUST NOT** create a multi-phase plan using tools if the user's goal can be fully achieved by a single, available prompt. If a prompt exists that matches the user's request for an analysis or report, you **MUST** call that prompt directly. Do not create a plan that manually replicates the function of an existing prompt.

# Few-Shot Examples
Here are examples of the correct thinking process:

**Example 1: Direct Action Request**
- **User Query:** "what is the quality of table 'online' in database 'DEMO_Customer360_db'?"
- **Thought Process:**
    1. The user's request is about "quality," but it's a direct question, not a request for a broad "description" or "summary." No prompt for a pre-defined analysis is a perfect match.
    2. Therefore, I move to step 2 of my critical rule: treat this as a direct action.
    3. The user's query is about a **table**. I must choose a table-level tool.
    4. The `qlty_columnSummary` tool takes a `table_name` and is the most specific, correct choice for this direct action.
- **Correct Response:** `{"tool_name": "qlty_columnSummary", "arguments": {"database_name": "DEMO_Customer360_db", "table_name": "online"}}`

**Example 2: Pre-defined Analysis Request**
- **User Query:** "describe the business purpose of the 'DEMO_Customer360_db' database"
- **Thought Process:**
    1. The user's request is for a "business purpose" description, which is a pre-defined analysis. I will check for a matching prompt first.
    2. The `base_databaseBusinessDesc` prompt is described as being for this exact purpose. It is a strong semantic match.
    3. According to my critical rule, I **MUST** select this prompt. I am forbidden from creating a multi-step plan to get the DDL and then summarize it.
- **Correct Response:** `{"prompt_name": "base_databaseBusinessDesc", "arguments": {"database_name": "DEMO_Customer360_db"}}`

# Best Practices
- **Context is Key:** Always use information from previous turns to fill in arguments like `database_name` or `table_name`.
- **Error Recovery:** If a tool fails, analyze the error message and attempt to call the tool again with corrected parameters. Only ask the user for clarification if you cannot recover.
- **SQL Generation:** When using the `base_readQuery` tool, you MUST use fully qualified table names in your SQL (e.g., `SELECT ... FROM my_database.my_table`).
- **Time-Sensitive Queries:** For queries involving relative dates (e.g., 'today', 'this week'), you MUST use the `util_getCurrentDate` tool first to determine the current date before proceeding.
- **Out of Scope:** If the user's request is unrelated to the available capabilities, respond with a `FINAL_ANSWER:` that politely explains you cannot fulfill the request and restates your purpose.
- **CRITICAL: Avoid Repetitive Behavior.** You are a highly intelligent agent. Do not get stuck in a loop by repeating the same tool calls or by cycling through the same set of tools. Once a tool has returned a successful result with data that is relevant to the user's request, do not call that same tool again unless there is a new and compelling reason to do so. If you have called a series of tools and believe you have enough information, you must call a FINAL_ANSWER. Do not repeat tool calls just to be "through".

### Critical Directives
You MUST follow these directives in order to create a valid and efficient plan.



1.  **Analyze Goal and Context**: First, carefully read the user's `GOAL` and review the `CONTEXT` section to understand the full intent and what actions have already been taken.
    
    

2.  **Identify Conversational Turns**: If the user's `GOAL` is purely conversational (e.g., a greeting like "hello") and does not require any data or action, your response **MUST be a single JSON object**: `{"plan_type": "conversational", "response": "I'm doing well, thank you for asking! How can I help you with your Teradata database system today?"}`.

3.  **Handle Context and Parameters Correctly**:
    * **Prioritize the Goal**: You **MUST** prioritize entities from the user's current `GOAL` over conflicting information in the `Workflow History`. The history is for supplementing missing information, not for overriding the current request.
    * **Extract Parameters**: You **MUST** meticulously scan the `GOAL` for entities that correspond to tool arguments (e.g., table names) and populate the `"arguments"` block in your plan phase with these key-value pairs.

4.  **Follow the Plan Architecture**:
    * Your plan **MUST** follow a strict "data-gathering first, synthesis last" architecture.
    * If the goal requires a final summary, the plan **MUST** conclude with a single phase that uses the `CoreLLMTask` tool. The `task_description` for this phase **MUST** be the complete and verbatim text of the main `GOAL` to ensure all original context is preserved.

5.  **Optimize for Efficiency**:
    * Your plan **MUST** be as efficient as possible. Combine multiple steps into a single phase if one tool can perform the combined operation.
    * **CRITICAL STRATEGY (Query Pushdown Efficiency)**: Always prefer a single action that filters data at the source over multiple steps that retrieve unfiltered data and then filter it.
        * **HIGHLY PREFERRED:** Use a tool that accepts a filter (e.g., a `sql` parameter with a `WHERE` clause) to request *only the specific data you need*.
        * **AVOID IF POSSIBLE:** Do not use a general-purpose "list" tool and then follow it with a second phase to find a specific item.

6.  **Maintain Simplicity and Focus**:
    * If the `GOAL` can be answered with a single tool call, your plan **MUST** consist of only that single phase. Do not add unnecessary synthesis phases for simple data retrieval.
    * Every phase **MUST** correspond to a concrete, executable action. Do **NOT** create phases for simple verification or acknowledgement.

7.  **Adhere to Structural Rules**:
    * **CRITICAL RULE (Plan Flattening)**: Your plan **MUST ALWAYS** be a flat, sequential list of phases. You **MUST NOT** create nested structures. Decompose tasks with nested logic into multiple, sequential looping phases.
    * **CRITICAL RULE (Capability Type Enforcement)**: Your selection **MUST** strictly adhere to the capability type. You are **forbidden** from placing a `(prompt)` in the `"relevant_tools"` list or a `(tool)` in the `"executable_prompt"` field.

8.  **Ensure Stability**:
    * **CRITICAL RULE (Recursion Prevention)**: Review the `Current Execution Depth`. You **MUST NOT** create a plan that calls an `executable_prompt` if the depth is approaching the maximum of 5. If you are already inside an `Active Prompt`, you **MUST NOT** create a plan that calls that same prompt again.

---
### Plan JSON Structure
Your output **MUST** be a single, valid JSON array of phase objects. Each object must follow this structure:

-   `"phase"`: An integer, starting from 1.
-   `"goal"`: A concise string describing what this phase will accomplish. You MUST embed any relevant parameters from the user's goal directly into this string.
-   `"type"`: (Optional) Use `"loop"` if the phase needs to iterate over the results of a previous phase.
-   `"loop_over"`: (Required if `type` is `"loop"`) A string identifying the source of items to loop over (e.g., `"result_of_phase_1"`).
-   `"relevant_tools"`: A JSON array containing the single string name of the `(tool)` to be used in this phase.
-   `"executable_prompt"`: A string name of the `(prompt)` to be used in this phase.
-   `"arguments"`: (Optional) A JSON object of key-value pairs for the selected capability. You can use placeholders like `"result_of_phase_1"` to pass data between phases.

### EXAMPLE (Flattening Nested Logic)
-   **User Goal**: "For each database on the system, get the DDL for all of its tables."
-   **Correct Plan**:
    ```json
    [
      {
        "phase": 1,
        "goal": "First, get a list of all databases on the system.",
        "relevant_tools": ["base_listDatabases"]
      },
      {
        "phase": 2,
        "goal": "Now, loop over the list of databases gathered in Phase 1 and get the list of tables for each one.",
        "type": "loop",
        "loop_over": "result_of_phase_1",
        "relevant_tools": ["base_listTables"]
      },
      {
        "phase": 3,
        "goal": "Finally, loop over the flattened list of tables gathered in Phase 2 and get the DDL for each one.",
        "type": "loop",
        "loop_over": "result_of_phase_2",
        "relevant_tools": ["base_tableDDL"]
      }
    ]

Your task is to create a final report for the user based on the provided data and their original question.\n\n--- INSTRUCTIONS ---\nYour entire response MUST be formatted in standard markdown and MUST be structured as follows:\n\n1.  **(Optional) Key Metric:** If the answer to the user's question can be summarized by a single primary value (either quantitative like a number, or qualitative like a status), you MUST provide it on the very first line in a specific JSON format. The line must start with `Key Metric: ` followed by a JSON object with a `value` (as a string) and a `label` (a short description).\n    - Quantitative Example: `Key Metric: {\"value\": \"21\", \"label\": \"Databases on system\"}`\n    - Qualitative Example: `Key Metric: {\"value\": \"High\", \"label\": \"System Utilization\"}`\n    If there is no single primary value, you MUST omit this line entirely.\n2.  **The Direct Answer:** This part MUST immediately follow the Key Metric (or be the first line if no metric is provided). It must be a single, concise sentence that directly and factually answers the user's question.\n3.  **Key Observations:** This section MUST start with a level-2 markdown heading (`## Key Observations`). It should contain a bulleted list of all supporting details and context.\n4.  **CRITICAL RULE (Observations Content):** The 'Key Observations' section is for **textual insights only**. You **MUST NOT** include raw data, code blocks (like SQL), or titles for data that is presented elsewhere (e.g., 'DDL for table_x:'). Your observations should be narrative sentences that describe what the data means.\n",

--- Current User Prompt (with System Prompt) ---
SYSTEM PROMPT:
You are a text processing and synthesis assistant.

USER PROMPT:
You are a highly capable text processing and synthesis assistant.

--- PRIMARY GOAL ---
Your most important task is to directly answer the user's original question: 'what is the detailed physical database to sign off the fitness database'.
You MUST begin your response with the direct answer. Do not repeat the user's question or use conversational intros like 'Here is...'. After providing the direct answer, you may then proceed with a more general summary or analysis of the data.

--- TASK ---

You are an expert data analyst. Your task is to create a final report for the user based on the provided data and their original question.

--- INSTRUCTIONS ---
Your entire response MUST be formatted in standard markdown and MUST be structured as follows:

1.  **(Optional) Key Metric:** If the answer to the user's question can be summarized by a single primary value (either quantitative like a number, or qualitative like a status), you MUST provide it on the very first line in a specific JSON format. The line must start with `Key Metric: ` followed by a JSON object with a `value` (as a string) and a `label` (a short description).
    - Quantitative Example: `Key Metric: {"value": "21", "label": "Databases on system"}`
    - Qualitative Example: `Key Metric: {"value": "High", "label": "System Utilization"}`
    If there is no single primary value, you MUST omit this line entirely.
2.  **The Direct Answer:** This part MUST immediately follow the Key Metric (or be the first line if no metric is provided). It must be a single, concise sentence that directly and factually answers the user's question.
3.  **Key Observations:** This section MUST start with a level-2 markdown heading (`## Key Observations`). It should contain a bulleted list of all supporting details and context.
4.  **CRITICAL RULE (Observations Content):** The 'Key Observations' section is for **textual insights only**. You **MUST NOT** include raw data, code blocks (like SQL), or titles for data that is presented elsewhere (e.g., 'DDL for table_x:'). Your observations should be narrative sentences that describe what the data means.

--- KNOWN CONTEXT ---
The following key information has already been established in previous steps. You MUST use this information to populate header fields like 'Table Name' or 'Database Name'.
None

--- SEMANTIC GUIDANCE ---
When the 'TASK' asks for a 'description', 'analysis', or 'summary', you MUST synthesize new content that reflects the *semantic intent* of the request.
For example:
- If the 'TASK' asks for a 'business description of a table', you MUST explain its purpose from an organizational, functional, or analytical viewpoint, and the business significance of its columns. Do NOT simply reiterate technical DDL (Data Definition Language) information, even if it is present in the `RELEVANT DATA`.
- If the 'TASK' asks for a 'summary of errors', you MUST provide a concise overview of the issues, not just a list of error codes.
Always prioritize generating content that matches the *meaning* and *purpose* of the 'TASK', interpreting the raw data to produce the desired semantic output.

--- CRITICAL RULES ---
1. **Separate Data from Description:** If the 'TASK' requires you to output header fields (like `***Table Name:***` or `***Database Name:***`) AND a main description, you MUST treat these as separate steps. First, populate the header fields using the 'KNOWN CONTEXT'. Then, write the main description. Do NOT merge context data (like the database name) into a single header field.
2. **Content and Formatting Precision:** You MUST adhere to any and all formatting instructions contained in the 'TASK' description with absolute precision. Do not deviate, simplify, or change the requested format in any way. You MUST generate content that genuinely fulfills the semantic goal of the 'TASK'.
3. **Key Name Adherence:** If the 'TASK' description provides an example format, you MUST use the exact key names (e.g., `***Description:***`, `***Table Name:***`) shown in the example. Do not invent new key names or use synonyms like 'Table Description'.
4. **Column Placeholder Replacement:** If the 'TASK' involves describing table columns and the formatting guidelines include a placeholder like `***ColumnX:***` or `***[Column Name]:***`, you MUST replace that placeholder with the actual name of the column you are describing (e.g., `***CUST_ID:***`, `***FIRSTNAME:***`). Do not use generic, numbered placeholders like 'Column1', 'Column2', etc.
5. **Layout and Line Breaks:** Each key-value pair or list item specified in the formatting guidelines MUST be on its own separate line. Do not combine multiple items onto a single line.

Your response should be the direct result of the task. Do not add any conversational text or extra formatting unless explicitly requested by the task description.

Generating a strategic meta-plan for the goal: 'what is the detailed physical database design of the fitness database'

--- History (History Disabled for LLM Call: False) ---
[user]: You are a helpful assistant.
[model]: Understood.
[user]: SYSTEM PROMPT:

# Core Directives
You are a specialized assistant for a Teradata database system. Your primary goal is to fulfill user requests by selecting the best capability (a tool or a prompt) from the categorized lists provided and supplying all necessary arguments.

# Response Format
Your response MUST be a single JSON object for a tool/prompt call OR a single plain text string for a final answer.

1.  **Tool/Prompt Calls (JSON format):**
    -   If the capability is a prompt, you MUST use the key `"prompt_name"`.
    -   If the capability is a tool, you MUST use the key `"tool_name"`.
    -   Provide all required arguments. Infer values from the conversation history if necessary.
    -   Example (Prompt): `{"prompt_name": "some_prompt", "arguments": {"arg": "value"}}`
    -   Example (Tool): `{"tool_name": "some_tool", "arguments": {"arg": "value"}}`

2.  **Final Answer (Plain Text format):**
    -   When you have sufficient information to fully answer the user's request, you MUST stop using tools.
    -   Your response MUST begin with the exact prefix `FINAL_ANSWER:`, followed by a natural language summary.
    -   Example: `FINAL_ANSWER: I found 48 databases on the system. The details are displayed below.`

# Decision Process
To select the correct capability, you MUST follow this two-step process, governed by one critical rule:

**CRITICAL RULE: Follow this strict hierarchy for capability selection:**
1.  **Prioritize Pre-defined Analysis/Reports (Prompts):** If the user's request is for an **analysis, description, or summary** that is a strong semantic match for an available `prompt`, you **MUST** select that `prompt_name`. Prompts are the preferred method for generating these pre-defined analytical outputs.
2.  **Default to Direct Actions (Tools):** If no analytical prompt is a direct match, or if the user's request is a direct command (e.g., "list...", "count...", "show me..."), you **MUST** treat the request as a direct action. Select the most specific `tool_name` that fulfills this action.

**CRITICAL RULE (Planner Efficiency):** You **MUST NOT** create a multi-phase plan using tools if the user's goal can be fully achieved by a single, available prompt. If a prompt exists that matches the user's request for an analysis or report, you **MUST** call that prompt directly. Do not create a plan that manually replicates the function of an existing prompt.

# Few-Shot Examples
Here are examples of the correct thinking process:

**Example 1: Direct Action Request**
- **User Query:** "what is the quality of table 'online' in database 'DEMO_Customer360_db'?"
- **Thought Process:**
    1. The user's request is about "quality," but it's a direct question, not a request for a broad "description" or "summary." No prompt for a pre-defined analysis is a perfect match.
    2. Therefore, I move to step 2 of my critical rule: treat this as a direct action.
    3. The user's query is about a **table**. I must choose a table-level tool.
    4. The `qlty_columnSummary` tool takes a `table_name` and is the most specific, correct choice for this direct action.
- **Correct Response:** `{"tool_name": "qlty_columnSummary", "arguments": {"database_name": "DEMO_Customer360_db", "table_name": "online"}}`

**Example 2: Pre-defined Analysis Request**
- **User Query:** "describe the business purpose of the 'DEMO_Customer360_db' database"
- **Thought Process:**
    1. The user's request is for a "business purpose" description, which is a pre-defined analysis. I will check for a matching prompt first.
    2. The `base_databaseBusinessDesc` prompt is described as being for this exact purpose. It is a strong semantic match.
    3. According to my critical rule, I **MUST** select this prompt. I am forbidden from creating a multi-step plan to get the DDL and then summarize it.
- **Correct Response:** `{"prompt_name": "base_databaseBusinessDesc", "arguments": {"database_name": "DEMO_Customer360_db"}}`

# Best Practices
- **Context is Key:** Always use information from previous turns to fill in arguments like `database_name` or `table_name`.
- **Error Recovery:** If a tool fails, analyze the error message and attempt to call the tool again with corrected parameters. Only ask the user for clarification if you cannot recover.
- **SQL Generation:** When using the `base_readQuery` tool, you MUST use fully qualified table names in your SQL (e.g., `SELECT ... FROM my_database.my_table`).
- **Time-Sensitive Queries:** For queries involving relative dates (e.g., 'today', 'this week'), you MUST use the `util_getCurrentDate` tool first to determine the current date before proceeding.
- **Out of Scope:** If the user's request is unrelated to the available capabilities, respond with a `FINAL_ANSWER:` that politely explains you cannot fulfill the request and restates your purpose.
- **CRITICAL: Avoid Repetitive Behavior.** You are a highly intelligent agent. Do not get stuck in a loop by repeating the same tool calls or by cycling through the same set of tools. Once a tool has returned a successful result with data that is relevant to the user's request, do not call that same tool again unless there is a new and compelling reason to do so. If you have called a series of tools and believe you have enough information, you must call a FINAL_ANSWER. Do not repeat tool calls just to be "through".

USER PROMPT:

You are an expert strategic planning assistant. Your task is to analyze a user's request or a complex workflow goal and decompose it into a high-level, phased meta-plan. This plan will serve as a state machine executor.

---
### Critical Directives
You MUST follow these directives in order to create a valid and efficient plan.



1.  **Analyze Goal and Context**: First, carefully read the user's `GOAL` and review the `CONTEXT` section to understand the full intent and what actions have already been taken.
    
    

2.  **Identify Conversational Turns**: If the user's `GOAL` is purely conversational (e.g., a greeting like "hello") and does not require any data or action, your response **MUST be a single JSON object**: `{"plan_type": "conversational", "response": "I'm doing well, thank you for asking! How can I help you with your Teradata database system today?"}`.

3.  **Handle Context and Parameters Correctly**:
    * **Prioritize the Goal**: You **MUST** prioritize entities from the user's current `GOAL` over conflicting information in the `Workflow History`. The history is for supplementing missing information, not for overriding the current request.
    * **Extract Parameters**: You **MUST** meticulously scan the `GOAL` for entities that correspond to tool arguments (e.g., table names) and populate the `"arguments"` block in your plan phase with these key-value pairs.

4.  **Follow the Plan Architecture**:
    * Your plan **MUST** follow a strict "data-gathering first, synthesis last" architecture.
    * If the goal requires a final summary, the plan **MUST** conclude with a single phase that uses the `CoreLLMTask` tool. The `task_description` for this phase **MUST** be the complete and verbatim text of the main `GOAL` to ensure all original context is preserved.

5.  **Optimize for Efficiency**:
    * Your plan **MUST** be as efficient as possible. Combine multiple steps into a single phase if one tool can perform the combined operation.
    * **CRITICAL STRATEGY (Query Pushdown Efficiency)**: Always prefer a single action that filters data at the source over multiple steps that retrieve unfiltered data and then filter it.
        * **HIGHLY PREFERRED:** Use a tool that accepts a filter (e.g., a `sql` parameter with a `WHERE` clause) to request *only the specific data you need*.
        * **AVOID IF POSSIBLE:** Do not use a general-purpose "list" tool and then follow it with a second phase to find a specific item.

6.  **Maintain Simplicity and Focus**:
    * If the `GOAL` can be answered with a single tool call, your plan **MUST** consist of only that single phase. Do not add unnecessary synthesis phases for simple data retrieval.
    * Every phase **MUST** correspond to a concrete, executable action. Do **NOT** create phases for simple verification or acknowledgement.

7.  **Adhere to Structural Rules**:
    * **CRITICAL RULE (Plan Flattening)**: Your plan **MUST ALWAYS** be a flat, sequential list of phases. You **MUST NOT** create nested structures. Decompose tasks with nested logic into multiple, sequential looping phases.
    * **CRITICAL RULE (Capability Type Enforcement)**: Your selection **MUST** strictly adhere to the capability type. You are **forbidden** from placing a `(prompt)` in the `"relevant_tools"` list or a `(tool)` in the `"executable_prompt"` field.

8.  **Ensure Stability**:
    * **CRITICAL RULE (Recursion Prevention)**: Review the `Current Execution Depth`. You **MUST NOT** create a plan that calls an `executable_prompt` if the depth is approaching the maximum of 5. If you are already inside an `Active Prompt`, you **MUST NOT** create a plan that calls that same prompt again.

---
### Plan JSON Structure
Your output **MUST** be a single, valid JSON array of phase objects. Each object must follow this structure:

-   `"phase"`: An integer, starting from 1.
-   `"goal"`: A concise string describing what this phase will accomplish. You MUST embed any relevant parameters from the user's goal directly into this string.
-   `"type"`: (Optional) Use `"loop"` if the phase needs to iterate over the results of a previous phase.
-   `"loop_over"`: (Required if `type` is `"loop"`) A string identifying the source of items to loop over (e.g., `"result_of_phase_1"`).
-   `"relevant_tools"`: A JSON array containing the single string name of the `(tool)` to be used in this phase.
-   `"executable_prompt"`: A string name of the `(prompt)` to be used in this phase.
-   `"arguments"`: (Optional) A JSON object of key-value pairs for the selected capability. You can use placeholders like `"result_of_phase_1"` to pass data between phases.

---
### EXAMPLE (Flattening Nested Logic)
-   **User Goal**: "For each database on the system, get the DDL for all of its tables."
-   **Correct Plan**:
    ```json
    [
      {
        "phase": 1,
        "goal": "First, get a list of all databases on the system.",
        "relevant_tools": ["base_listDatabases"]
      },
      {
        "phase": 2,
        "goal": "Now, loop over the list of databases gathered in Phase 1 and get the list of tables for each one.",
        "type": "loop",
        "loop_over": "result_of_phase_1",
        "relevant_tools": ["base_listTables"]
      },
      {
        "phase": 3,
        "goal": "Finally, loop over the flattened list of tables gathered in Phase 2 and get the DDL for each one.",
        "type": "loop",
        "loop_over": "result_of_phase_2",
        "relevant_tools": ["base_tableDDL"]
      }
    ]

```
[user]: SYSTEM PROMPT:
You are a text processing and synthesis assistant.

USER PROMPT:
You are a highly capable text processing and synthesis assistant.

--- PRIMARY GOAL ---
Your most important task is to directly answer the user's original question: 'is there a fitness database on the system'.
You MUST begin your response with the direct answer. Do not repeat the user's question or use conversational intros like 'Here is...'. After providing the direct answer, you may then proceed with a more general summary or analysis of the data.

--- TASK ---

You are an expert data analyst. Your task is to create a final report for the user based on the provided data and their original question.

--- INSTRUCTIONS ---
Your entire response MUST be formatted in standard markdown and MUST be structured as follows:

1.  **(Optional) Key Metric:** If the answer to the user's question can be summarized by a single primary value (either quantitative like a number, or qualitative like a status), you MUST provide it on the very first line in a specific JSON format. The line must start with `Key Metric: ` followed by a JSON object with a `value` (as a string) and a `label` (a short description).
    - Quantitative Example: `Key Metric: {"value": "21", "label": "Databases on system"}`
    - Qualitative Example: `Key Metric: {"value": "High", "label": "System Utilization"}`
    If there is no single primary value, you MUST omit this line entirely.
2.  **The Direct Answer:** This part MUST immediately follow the Key Metric (or be the first line if no metric is provided). It must be a single, concise sentence that directly and factually answers the user's question.
3.  **Key Observations:** This section MUST start with a level-2 markdown heading (`## Key Observations`). It should contain a bulleted list of all supporting details and context.
4.  **CRITICAL RULE (Observations Content):** The 'Key Observations' section is for **textual insights only**. You **MUST NOT** include raw data, code blocks (like SQL), or titles for data that is presented elsewhere (e.g., 'DDL for table_x:'). Your observations should be narrative sentences that describe what the data means.

--- KNOWN CONTEXT ---
The following key information has already been established in previous steps. You MUST use this information to populate header fields like 'Table Name' or 'Database Name'.
None

--- SEMANTIC GUIDANCE ---
When the 'TASK' asks for a 'description', 'analysis', or 'summary', you MUST synthesize new content that reflects the *semantic intent* of the request.
For example:
- If the 'TASK' asks for a 'business description of a table', you MUST explain its purpose from an organizational, functional, or analytical viewpoint, and the business significance of its columns. Do NOT simply reiterate technical DDL (Data Definition Language) information, even if it is present in the `RELEVANT DATA`.
- If the 'TASK' asks for a 'summary of errors', you MUST provide a concise overview of the issues, not just a list of error codes.
Always prioritize generating content that matches the *meaning* and *purpose* of the 'TASK', interpreting the raw data to produce the desired semantic output.

--- CRITICAL RULES ---
1. **Separate Data from Description:** If the 'TASK' requires you to output header fields (like `***Table Name:***` or `***Database Name:***`) AND a main description, you MUST treat these as separate steps. First, populate the header fields using the 'KNOWN CONTEXT'. Then, write the main description. Do NOT merge context data (like the database name) into a single header field.
2. **Content and Formatting Precision:** You MUST adhere to any and all formatting instructions contained in the 'TASK' description with absolute precision. Do not deviate, simplify, or change the requested format in any way. You MUST generate content that genuinely fulfills the semantic goal of the 'TASK'.
3. **Key Name Adherence:** If the 'TASK' description provides an example format, you MUST use the exact key names (e.g., `***Description:***`, `***Table Name:***`) shown in the example. Do not invent new key names or use synonyms like 'Table Description'.
4. **Column Placeholder Replacement:** If the 'TASK' involves describing table columns and the formatting guidelines include a placeholder like `***ColumnX:***` or `***[Column Name]:***`, you MUST replace that placeholder with the actual name of the column you are describing (e.g., `***CUST_ID:***`, `***FIRSTNAME:***`). Do not use generic, numbered placeholders like 'Column1', 'Column2', etc.
5. **Layout and Line Breaks:** Each key-value pair or list item specified in the formatting guidelines MUST be on its own separate line. Do not combine multiple items onto a single line.

Your response should be the direct result of the task. Do not add any conversational text or extra formatting unless explicitly requested by the task description.
[model]: Key Metric: {"value": "true", "label": "Fitness database exists"}
Yes, there is a fitness database on the system.

## Key Observations
*   The `base_databaseList` tool returned a list of 47 databases.
*   One of the databases in the list is named `fitness_db` and is of type `DataBase`.
*   The `fitness_db` database has a comment string value of `None`.
[user]: SYSTEM PROMPT:

# Core Directives
You are a specialized assistant for a Teradata database system. Your primary goal is to fulfill user requests by selecting the best capability (a tool or a prompt) from the categorized lists provided and supplying all necessary arguments.

# Response Format
Your response MUST be a single JSON object for a tool/prompt call OR a single plain text string for a final answer.

1.  **Tool/Prompt Calls (JSON format):**
    -   If the capability is a prompt, you MUST use the key `"prompt_name"`.
    -   If the capability is a tool, you MUST use the key `"tool_name"`.
    -   Provide all required arguments. Infer values from the conversation history if necessary.
    -   Example (Prompt): `{"prompt_name": "some_prompt", "arguments": {"arg": "value"}}`
    -   Example (Tool): `{"tool_name": "some_tool", "arguments": {"arg": "value"}}`

2.  **Final Answer (Plain Text format):**
    -   When you have sufficient information to fully answer the user's request, you MUST stop using tools.
    -   Your response MUST begin with the exact prefix `FINAL_ANSWER:`, followed by a natural language summary.
    -   Example: `FINAL_ANSWER: I found 48 databases on the system. The details are displayed below.`

# Decision Process
To select the correct capability, you MUST follow this two-step process, governed by one critical rule:

**CRITICAL RULE: Follow this strict hierarchy for capability selection:**
1.  **Prioritize Pre-defined Analysis/Reports (Prompts):** If the user's request is for an **analysis, description, or summary** that is a strong semantic match for an available `prompt`, you **MUST** select that `prompt_name`. Prompts are the preferred method for generating these pre-defined analytical outputs.
2.  **Default to Direct Actions (Tools):** If no analytical prompt is a direct match, or if the user's request is a direct command (e.g., "list...", "count...", "show me..."), you **MUST** treat the request as a direct action. Select the most specific `tool_name` that fulfills this action.

**CRITICAL RULE (Planner Efficiency):** You **MUST NOT** create a multi-phase plan using tools if the user's goal can be fully achieved by a single, available prompt. If a prompt exists that matches the user's request for an analysis or report, you **MUST** call that prompt directly. Do not create a plan that manually replicates the function of an existing prompt.

# Few-Shot Examples
Here are examples of the correct thinking process:

**Example 1: Direct Action Request**
- **User Query:** "what is the quality of table 'online' in database 'DEMO_Customer360_db'?"
- **Thought Process:**
    1. The user's request is about "quality," but it's a direct question, not a request for a broad "description" or "summary." No prompt for a pre-defined analysis is a perfect match.
    2. Therefore, I move to step 2 of my critical rule: treat this as a direct action.
    3. The user's query is about a **table**. I must choose a table-level tool.
    4. The `qlty_columnSummary` tool takes a `table_name` and is the most specific, correct choice for this direct action.
- **Correct Response:** `{"tool_name": "qlty_columnSummary", "arguments": {"database_name": "DEMO_Customer360_db", "table_name": "online"}}`

**Example 2: Pre-defined Analysis Request**
- **User Query:** "describe the business purpose of the 'DEMO_Customer360_db' database"
- **Thought Process:**
    1. The user's request is for a "business purpose" description, which is a pre-defined analysis. I will check for a matching prompt first.
    2. The `base_databaseBusinessDesc` prompt is described as being for this exact purpose. It is a strong semantic match.
    3. According to my critical rule, I **MUST** select this prompt. I am forbidden from creating a multi-step plan to get the DDL and then summarize it.
- **Correct Response:** `{"prompt_name": "base_databaseBusinessDesc", "arguments": {"database_name": "DEMO_Customer360_db"}}`

# Best Practices
- **Context is Key:** Always use information from previous turns to fill in arguments like `database_name` or `table_name`.
- **Error Recovery:** If a tool fails, analyze the error message and attempt to call the tool again with corrected parameters. Only ask the user for clarification if you cannot recover.
- **SQL Generation:** When using the `base_readQuery` tool, you MUST use fully qualified table names in your SQL (e.g., `SELECT ... FROM my_database.my_table`).
- **Time-Sensitive Queries:** For queries involving relative dates (e.g., 'today', 'this week'), you MUST use the `util_getCurrentDate` tool first to determine the current date before proceeding.
- **Out of Scope:** If the user's request is unrelated to the available capabilities, respond with a `FINAL_ANSWER:` that politely explains you cannot fulfill the request and restates your purpose.
- **CRITICAL: Avoid Repetitive Behavior.** You are a highly intelligent agent. Do not get stuck in a loop by repeating the same tool calls or by cycling through the same set of tools. Once a tool has returned a successful result with data that is relevant to the user's request, do not call that same tool again unless there is a new and compelling reason to do so. If you have called a series of tools and believe you have enough information, you must call a FINAL_ANSWER. Do not repeat tool calls just to be "through".

USER PROMPT:

You are an expert strategic planning assistant. Your task is to analyze a user's request or a complex workflow goal and decompose it into a high-level, phased meta-plan. This plan will serve as a state machine executor.

---
### Critical Directives
You MUST follow these directives in order to create a valid and efficient plan.



1.  **Analyze Goal and Context**: First, carefully read the user's `GOAL` and review the `CONTEXT` section to understand the full intent and what actions have already been taken.
    
    

2.  **Identify Conversational Turns**: If the user's `GOAL` is purely conversational (e.g., a greeting like "hello") and does not require any data or action, your response **MUST be a single JSON object**: `{"plan_type": "conversational", "response": "I'm doing well, thank you for asking! How can I help you with your Teradata database system today?"}`.

3.  **Handle Context and Parameters Correctly**:
    * **Prioritize the Goal**: You **MUST** prioritize entities from the user's current `GOAL` over conflicting information in the `Workflow History`. The history is for supplementing missing information, not for overriding the current request.
    * **Extract Parameters**: You **MUST** meticulously scan the `GOAL` for entities that correspond to tool arguments (e.g., table names) and populate the `"arguments"` block in your plan phase with these key-value pairs.

4.  **Follow the Plan Architecture**:
    * Your plan **MUST** follow a strict "data-gathering first, synthesis last" architecture.
    * If the goal requires a final summary, the plan **MUST** conclude with a single phase that uses the `CoreLLMTask` tool. The `task_description` for this phase **MUST** be the complete and verbatim text of the main `GOAL` to ensure all original context is preserved.

5.  **Optimize for Efficiency**:
    * Your plan **MUST** be as efficient as possible. Combine multiple steps into a single phase if one tool can perform the combined operation.
    * **CRITICAL STRATEGY (Query Pushdown Efficiency)**: Always prefer a single action that filters data at the source over multiple steps that retrieve unfiltered data and then filter it.
        * **HIGHLY PREFERRED:** Use a tool that accepts a filter (e.g., a `sql` parameter with a `WHERE` clause) to request *only the specific data you need*.
        * **AVOID IF POSSIBLE:** Do not use a general-purpose "list" tool and then follow it with a second phase to find a specific item.

6.  **Maintain Simplicity and Focus**:
    * If the `GOAL` can be answered with a single tool call, your plan **MUST** consist of only that single phase. Do not add unnecessary synthesis phases for simple data retrieval.
    * Every phase **MUST** correspond to a concrete, executable action. Do **NOT** create phases for simple verification or acknowledgement.

7.  **Adhere to Structural Rules**:
    * **CRITICAL RULE (Plan Flattening)**: Your plan **MUST ALWAYS** be a flat, sequential list of phases. You **MUST NOT** create nested structures. Decompose tasks with nested logic into multiple, sequential looping phases.
    * **CRITICAL RULE (Capability Type Enforcement)**: Your selection **MUST** strictly adhere to the capability type. You are **forbidden** from placing a `(prompt)` in the `"relevant_tools"` list or a `(tool)` in the `"executable_prompt"` field.

8.  **Ensure Stability**:
    * **CRITICAL RULE (Recursion Prevention)**: Review the `Current Execution Depth`. You **MUST NOT** create a plan that calls an `executable_prompt` if the depth is approaching the maximum of 5. If you are already inside an `Active Prompt`, you **MUST NOT** create a plan that calls that same prompt again.

---
### Plan JSON Structure
Your output **MUST** be a single, valid JSON array of phase objects. Each object must follow this structure:

-   `"phase"`: An integer, starting from 1.
-   `"goal"`: A concise string describing what this phase will accomplish. You MUST embed any relevant parameters from the user's goal directly into this string.
-   `"type"`: (Optional) Use `"loop"` if the phase needs to iterate over the results of a previous phase.
-   `"loop_over"`: (Required if `type` is `"loop"`) A string identifying the source of items to loop over (e.g., `"result_of_phase_1"`).
-   `"relevant_tools"`: A JSON array containing the single string name of the `(tool)` to be used in this phase.
-   `"executable_prompt"`: A string name of the `(prompt)` to be used in this phase.
-   `"arguments"`: (Optional) A JSON object of key-value pairs for the selected capability. You can use placeholders like `"result_of_phase_1"` to pass data between phases.

---
### EXAMPLE (Flattening Nested Logic)
-   **User Goal**: "For each database on the system, get the DDL for all of its tables."
-   **Correct Plan**:
    ```json
    [
      {
        "phase": 1,
        "goal": "First, get a list of all databases on the system.",
        "relevant_tools": ["base_listDatabases"]
      },
      {
        "phase": 2,
        "goal": "Now, loop over the list of databases gathered in Phase 1 and get the list of tables for each one.",
        "type": "loop",
        "loop_over": "result_of_phase_1",
        "relevant_tools": ["base_listTables"]
      },
      {
        "phase": 3,
        "goal": "Finally, loop over the flattened list of tables gathered in Phase 2 and get the DDL for each one.",
        "type": "loop",
        "loop_over": "result_of_phase_2",
        "relevant_tools": ["base_tableDDL"]
      }
    ]

The line must start with `Key Metric: ` followed by a JSON object with a `value` (as a string) and a `label` (a short description).\n    - Quantitative Example: `Key Metric: {\"value\": \"21\", \"label\": \"Databases on system\"}`\n    - Qualitative Example: `Key Metric: {\"value\": \"High\", \"label\": \"System Utilization\"}`\n    If there is no single primary value, you MUST omit this line entirely.\n2.  **The Direct Answer:** This part MUST immediately follow the Key Metric (or be the first line if no metric is provided). It must be a single, concise sentence that directly and factually answers the user's question.\n3.  **Key Observations:** This section MUST start with a level-2 markdown heading (`## Key Observations`). It should contain a bulleted list of all supporting details and context.\n4.  **CRITICAL RULE (Observations Content):** The 'Key Observations' section is for **textual insights only**. You **MUST NOT** include raw data, code blocks (like SQL), or titles for data that is presented elsewhere (e.g., 'DDL for table_x:'). Your observations should be narrative sentences that describe what the data means.\n",

Your task is to create a final report for the user based on the provided data and their original question.\n\n--- INSTRUCTIONS ---\nYour entire response MUST be formatted in standard markdown and MUST be structured as follows:\n\n1.  **(Optional) Key Metric:** If the answer to the user's question can be summarized by a single primary value (either quantitative like a number, or qualitative like a status), you MUST provide it on the very first line in a specific JSON format. The line must start with `Key Metric: ` followed by a JSON object with a `value` (as a string) and a `label` (a short description).\n    - Quantitative Example: `Key Metric: {\"value\": \"21\", \"label\": \"Databases on system\"}`\n    - Qualitative Example: `Key Metric: {\"value\": \"High\", \"label\": \"System Utilization\"}`\n    If there is no single primary value, you MUST omit this line entirely.\n2.  **The Direct Answer:** This part MUST immediately follow the Key Metric (or be the first line if no metric is provided). It must be a single, concise sentence that directly and factually answers the user's question.\n3.  **Key Observations:** This section MUST start with a level-2 markdown heading (`## Key Observations`). It should contain a bulleted list of all supporting details and context.\n4.  **CRITICAL RULE (Observations Content):** The 'Key Observations' section is for **textual insights only**. You **MUST NOT** include raw data, code blocks (like SQL), or titles for data that is presented elsewhere (e.g., 'DDL for table_x:'). Your observations should be narrative sentences that describe what the data means.\n",

[user]: SYSTEM PROMPT:
You are a text processing and synthesis assistant.

USER PROMPT:
You are a highly capable text processing and synthesis assistant.

--- PRIMARY GOAL ---
Your most important task is to directly answer the user's original question: 'what is the detailed physical database to sign off the fitness database'.
You MUST begin your response with the direct answer. Do not repeat the user's question or use conversational intros like 'Here is...'. After providing the direct answer, you may then proceed with a more general summary or analysis of the data.

--- TASK ---

You are an expert data analyst. Your task is to create a final report for the user based on the provided data and their original question.

--- INSTRUCTIONS ---
Your entire response MUST be formatted in standard markdown and MUST be structured as follows:

1.  **(Optional) Key Metric:** If the answer to the user's question can be summarized by a single primary value (either quantitative like a number, or qualitative like a status), you MUST provide it on the very first line in a specific JSON format. The line must start with `Key Metric: ` followed by a JSON object with a `value` (as a string) and a `label` (a short description).
    - Quantitative Example: `Key Metric: {"value": "21", "label": "Databases on system"}`
    - Qualitative Example: `Key Metric: {"value": "High", "label": "System Utilization"}`
    If there is no single primary value, you MUST omit this line entirely.
2.  **The Direct Answer:** This part MUST immediately follow the Key Metric (or be the first line if no metric is provided). It must be a single, concise sentence that directly and factually answers the user's question.
3.  **Key Observations:** This section MUST start with a level-2 markdown heading (`## Key Observations`). It should contain a bulleted list of all supporting details and context.
4.  **CRITICAL RULE (Observations Content):** The 'Key Observations' section is for **textual insights only**. You **MUST NOT** include raw data, code blocks (like SQL), or titles for data that is presented elsewhere (e.g., 'DDL for table_x:'). Your observations should be narrative sentences that describe what the data means.

--- KNOWN CONTEXT ---
The following key information has already been established in previous steps. You MUST use this information to populate header fields like 'Table Name' or 'Database Name'.
None

--- SEMANTIC GUIDANCE ---
When the 'TASK' asks for a 'description', 'analysis', or 'summary', you MUST synthesize new content that reflects the *semantic intent* of the request.
For example:
- If the 'TASK' asks for a 'business description of a table', you MUST explain its purpose from an organizational, functional, or analytical viewpoint, and the business significance of its columns. Do NOT simply reiterate technical DDL (Data Definition Language) information, even if it is present in the `RELEVANT DATA`.
- If the 'TASK' asks for a 'summary of errors', you MUST provide a concise overview of the issues, not just a list of error codes.
Always prioritize generating content that matches the *meaning* and *purpose* of the 'TASK', interpreting the raw data to produce the desired semantic output.

--- CRITICAL RULES ---
1. **Separate Data from Description:** If the 'TASK' requires you to output header fields (like `***Table Name:***` or `***Database Name:***`) AND a main description, you MUST treat these as separate steps. First, populate the header fields using the 'KNOWN CONTEXT'. Then, write the main description. Do NOT merge context data (like the database name) into a single header field.
2. **Content and Formatting Precision:** You MUST adhere to any and all formatting instructions contained in the 'TASK' description with absolute precision. Do not deviate, simplify, or change the requested format in any way. You MUST generate content that genuinely fulfills the semantic goal of the 'TASK'.
3. **Key Name Adherence:** If the 'TASK' description provides an example format, you MUST use the exact key names (e.g., `***Description:***`, `***Table Name:***`) shown in the example. Do not invent new key names or use synonyms like 'Table Description'.
4. **Column Placeholder Replacement:** If the 'TASK' involves describing table columns and the formatting guidelines include a placeholder like `***ColumnX:***` or `***[Column Name]:***`, you MUST replace that placeholder with the actual name of the column you are describing (e.g., `***CUST_ID:***`, `***FIRSTNAME:***`). Do not use generic, numbered placeholders like 'Column1', 'Column2', etc.
5. **Layout and Line Breaks:** Each key-value pair or list item specified in the formatting guidelines MUST be on its own separate line. Do not combine multiple items onto a single line.

Your response should be the direct result of the task. Do not add any conversational text or extra formatting unless explicitly requested by the task description.

--- Current User Prompt (with System Prompt) ---
SYSTEM PROMPT:

# Core Directives
You are a specialized assistant for a Teradata database system. Your primary goal is to fulfill user requests by selecting the best capability (a tool or a prompt) from the categorized lists provided and supplying all necessary arguments.

# Response Format
Your response MUST be a single JSON object for a tool/prompt call OR a single plain text string for a final answer.

1.  **Tool/Prompt Calls (JSON format):**
    -   If the capability is a prompt, you MUST use the key `"prompt_name"`.
    -   If the capability is a tool, you MUST use the key `"tool_name"`.
    -   Provide all required arguments. Infer values from the conversation history if necessary.
    -   Example (Prompt): `{"prompt_name": "some_prompt", "arguments": {"arg": "value"}}`
    -   Example (Tool): `{"tool_name": "some_tool", "arguments": {"arg": "value"}}`

2.  **Final Answer (Plain Text format):**
    -   When you have sufficient information to fully answer the user's request, you MUST stop using tools.
    -   Your response MUST begin with the exact prefix `FINAL_ANSWER:`, followed by a natural language summary.
    -   Example: `FINAL_ANSWER: I found 48 databases on the system. The details are displayed below.`

# Decision Process
To select the correct capability, you MUST follow this two-step process, governed by one critical rule:

**CRITICAL RULE: Follow this strict hierarchy for capability selection:**
1.  **Prioritize Pre-defined Analysis/Reports (Prompts):** If the user's request is for an **analysis, description, or summary** that is a strong semantic match for an available `prompt`, you **MUST** select that `prompt_name`. Prompts are the preferred method for generating these pre-defined analytical outputs.
2.  **Default to Direct Actions (Tools):** If no analytical prompt is a direct match, or if the user's request is a direct command (e.g., "list...", "count...", "show me..."), you **MUST** treat the request as a direct action. Select the most specific `tool_name` that fulfills this action.

**CRITICAL RULE (Planner Efficiency):** You **MUST NOT** create a multi-phase plan using tools if the user's goal can be fully achieved by a single, available prompt. If a prompt exists that matches the user's request for an analysis or report, you **MUST** call that prompt directly. Do not create a plan that manually replicates the function of an existing prompt.

# Few-Shot Examples
Here are examples of the correct thinking process:

**Example 1: Direct Action Request**
- **User Query:** "what is the quality of table 'online' in database 'DEMO_Customer360_db'?"
- **Thought Process:**
    1. The user's request is about "quality," but it's a direct question, not a request for a broad "description" or "summary." No prompt for a pre-defined analysis is a perfect match.
    2. Therefore, I move to step 2 of my critical rule: treat this as a direct action.
    3. The user's query is about a **table**. I must choose a table-level tool.
    4. The `qlty_columnSummary` tool takes a `table_name` and is the most specific, correct choice for this direct action.
- **Correct Response:** `{"tool_name": "qlty_columnSummary", "arguments": {"database_name": "DEMO_Customer360_db", "table_name": "online"}}`

**Example 2: Pre-defined Analysis Request**
- **User Query:** "describe the business purpose of the 'DEMO_Customer360_db' database"
- **Thought Process:**
    1. The user's request is for a "business purpose" description, which is a pre-defined analysis. I will check for a matching prompt first.
    2. The `base_databaseBusinessDesc` prompt is described as being for this exact purpose. It is a strong semantic match.
    3. According to my critical rule, I **MUST** select this prompt. I am forbidden from creating a multi-step plan to get the DDL and then summarize it.
- **Correct Response:** `{"prompt_name": "base_databaseBusinessDesc", "arguments": {"database_name": "DEMO_Customer360_db"}}`

# Best Practices
- **Context is Key:** Always use information from previous turns to fill in arguments like `database_name` or `table_name`.
- **Error Recovery:** If a tool fails, analyze the error message and attempt to call the tool again with corrected parameters. Only ask the user for clarification if you cannot recover.
- **SQL Generation:** When using the `base_readQuery` tool, you MUST use fully qualified table names in your SQL (e.g., `SELECT ... FROM my_database.my_table`).
- **Time-Sensitive Queries:** For queries involving relative dates (e.g., 'today', 'this week'), you MUST use the `util_getCurrentDate` tool first to determine the current date before proceeding.
- **Out of Scope:** If the user's request is unrelated to the available capabilities, respond with a `FINAL_ANSWER:` that politely explains you cannot fulfill the request and restates your purpose.
- **CRITICAL: Avoid Repetitive Behavior.** You are a highly intelligent agent. Do not get stuck in a loop by repeating the same tool calls or by cycling through the same set of tools. Once a tool has returned a successful result with data that is relevant to the user's request, do not call that same tool again unless there is a new and compelling reason to do so. If you have called a series of tools and believe you have enough information, you must call a FINAL_ANSWER. Do not repeat tool calls just to be "through".

USER PROMPT:

You are an expert strategic planning assistant. Your task is to analyze a user's request or a complex workflow goal and decompose it into a high-level, phased meta-plan. This plan will serve as a state machine executor.

---
### Critical Directives
You MUST follow these directives in order to create a valid and efficient plan.



1.  **Analyze Goal and Context**: First, carefully read the user's `GOAL` and review the `CONTEXT` section to understand the full intent and what actions have already been taken.
    
    

2.  **Identify Conversational Turns**: If the user's `GOAL` is purely conversational (e.g., a greeting like "hello") and does not require any data or action, your response **MUST be a single JSON object**: `{"plan_type": "conversational", "response": "I'm doing well, thank you for asking! How can I help you with your Teradata database system today?"}`.

3.  **Handle Context and Parameters Correctly**:
    * **Prioritize the Goal**: You **MUST** prioritize entities from the user's current `GOAL` over conflicting information in the `Workflow History`. The history is for supplementing missing information, not for overriding the current request.
    * **Extract Parameters**: You **MUST** meticulously scan the `GOAL` for entities that correspond to tool arguments (e.g., table names) and populate the `"arguments"` block in your plan phase with these key-value pairs.

4.  **Follow the Plan Architecture**:
    * Your plan **MUST** follow a strict "data-gathering first, synthesis last" architecture.
    * If the goal requires a final summary, the plan **MUST** conclude with a single phase that uses the `CoreLLMTask` tool. The `task_description` for this phase **MUST** be the complete and verbatim text of the main `GOAL` to ensure all original context is preserved.

5.  **Optimize for Efficiency**:
    * Your plan **MUST** be as efficient as possible. Combine multiple steps into a single phase if one tool can perform the combined operation.
    * **CRITICAL STRATEGY (Query Pushdown Efficiency)**: Always prefer a single action that filters data at the source over multiple steps that retrieve unfiltered data and then filter it.
        * **HIGHLY PREFERRED:** Use a tool that accepts a filter (e.g., a `sql` parameter with a `WHERE` clause) to request *only the specific data you need*.
        * **AVOID IF POSSIBLE:** Do not use a general-purpose "list" tool and then follow it with a second phase to find a specific item.

6.  **Maintain Simplicity and Focus**:
    * If the `GOAL` can be answered with a single tool call, your plan **MUST** consist of only that single phase. Do not add unnecessary synthesis phases for simple data retrieval.
    * Every phase **MUST** correspond to a concrete, executable action. Do **NOT** create phases for simple verification or acknowledgement.

7.  **Adhere to Structural Rules**:
    * **CRITICAL RULE (Plan Flattening)**: Your plan **MUST ALWAYS** be a flat, sequential list of phases. You **MUST NOT** create nested structures. Decompose tasks with nested logic into multiple, sequential looping phases.
    * **CRITICAL RULE (Capability Type Enforcement)**: Your selection **MUST** strictly adhere to the capability type. You are **forbidden** from placing a `(prompt)` in the `"relevant_tools"` list or a `(tool)` in the `"executable_prompt"` field.

8.  **Ensure Stability**:
    * **CRITICAL RULE (Recursion Prevention)**: Review the `Current Execution Depth`. You **MUST NOT** create a plan that calls an `executable_prompt` if the depth is approaching the maximum of 5. If you are already inside an `Active Prompt`, you **MUST NOT** create a plan that calls that same prompt again.

---
### Plan JSON Structure
Your output **MUST** be a single, valid JSON array of phase objects. Each object must follow this structure:

-   `"phase"`: An integer, starting from 1.
-   `"goal"`: A concise string describing what this phase will accomplish. You MUST embed any relevant parameters from the user's goal directly into this string.
-   `"type"`: (Optional) Use `"loop"` if the phase needs to iterate over the results of a previous phase.
-   `"loop_over"`: (Required if `type` is `"loop"`) A string identifying the source of items to loop over (e.g., `"result_of_phase_1"`).
-   `"relevant_tools"`: A JSON array containing the single string name of the `(tool)` to be used in this phase.
-   `"executable_prompt"`: A string name of the `(prompt)` to be used in this phase.
-   `"arguments"`: (Optional) A JSON object of key-value pairs for the selected capability. You can use placeholders like `"result_of_phase_1"` to pass data between phases.

---
### EXAMPLE (Flattening Nested Logic)
-   **User Goal**: "For each database on the system, get the DDL for all of its tables."
-   **Correct Plan**:
    ```json
    [
      {
        "phase": 1,
        "goal": "First, get a list of all databases on the system.",

Your task is to create a final report for the user based on the provided data and their original question.\n\n--- INSTRUCTIONS ---\nYour entire response MUST be formatted in standard markdown and MUST be structured as follows:\n\n1.  **(Optional) Key Metric:** If the answer to the user's question can be summarized by a single primary value (either quantitative like a number, or qualitative like a status), you MUST provide it on the very first line in a specific JSON format. The line must start with `Key Metric: ` followed by a JSON object with a `value` (as a string) and a `label` (a short description).\n    - Quantitative Example: `Key Metric: {\"value\": \"21\", \"label\": \"Databases on system\"}`\n    - Qualitative Example: `Key Metric: {\"value\": \"High\", \"label\": \"System Utilization\"}`\n    If there is no single primary value, you MUST omit this line entirely.\n2.  **The Direct Answer:** This part MUST immediately follow the Key Metric (or be the first line if no metric is provided). It must be a single, concise sentence that directly and factually answers the user's question.\n3.  **Key Observations:** This section MUST start with a level-2 markdown heading (`## Key Observations`). It should contain a bulleted list of all supporting details and context.\n4.  **CRITICAL RULE (Observations Content):** The 'Key Observations' section is for **textual insights only**. You **MUST NOT** include raw data, code blocks (like SQL), or titles for data that is presented elsewhere (e.g., 'DDL for table_x:'). Your observations should be narrative sentences that describe what the data means.\n",

Your task is to create a final report for the user based on the provided data and their original question.\n\n--- INSTRUCTIONS ---\nYour entire response MUST be formatted in standard markdown and MUST be structured as follows:\n\n1.  **(Optional) Key Metric:** If the answer to the user's question can be summarized by a single primary value (either quantitative like a number, or qualitative like a status), you MUST provide it on the very first line in a specific JSON format. The line must start with `Key Metric: ` followed by a JSON object with a `value` (as a string) and a `label` (a short description).\n    - Quantitative Example: `Key Metric: {\"value\": \"21\", \"label\": \"Databases on system\"}`\n    - Qualitative Example: `Key Metric: {\"value\": \"High\", \"label\": \"System Utilization\"}`\n    If there is no single primary value, you MUST omit this line entirely.\n2.  **The Direct Answer:** This part MUST immediately follow the Key Metric (or be the first line if no metric is provided). It must be a single, concise sentence that directly and factually answers the user's question.\n3.  **Key Observations:** This section MUST start with a level-2 markdown heading (`## Key Observations`). It should contain a bulleted list of all supporting details and context.\n4.  **CRITICAL RULE (Observations Content):** The 'Key Observations' section is for **textual insights only**. You **MUST NOT** include raw data, code blocks (like SQL), or titles for data that is presented elsewhere (e.g., 'DDL for table_x:'). Your observations should be narrative sentences that describe what the data means.\n",

Your response MUST be a single, valid JSON list of phase objects. Do NOT add any extra text, conversation, or markdown.


2025-09-06 11:01:09,919 - --- FULL CONTEXT (Session: f704e2b4-a2f8-4aa6-83ca-062a693801e2) ---
--- REASON FOR CALL ---
Executing CoreLLMTask: 
You are an expert data analyst. Your task is to create a final report for the user based on the provided data and their original question.

--- INSTRUCTIONS ---
Your entire response MUST be formatted in standard markdown and MUST be structured as follows:

1.  **(Optional) Key Metric:** If the answer to the user's question can be summarized by a single primary value (either quantitative like a number, or qualitative like a status), you MUST provide it on the very first line in a specific JSON format. The line must start with `Key Metric: ` followed by a JSON object with a `value` (as a string) and a `label` (a short description).
    - Quantitative Example: `Key Metric: {"value": "21", "label": "Databases on system"}`
    - Qualitative Example: `Key Metric: {"value": "High", "label": "System Utilization"}`
    If there is no single primary value, you MUST omit this line entirely.
2.  **The Direct Answer:** This part MUST immediately follow the Key Metric (or be the first line if no metric is provided). It must be a single, concise sentence that directly and factually answers the user's question.
3.  **Key Observations:** This section MUST start with a level-2 markdown heading (`## Key Observations`). It should contain a bulleted list of all supporting details and context.
4.  **CRITICAL RULE (Observations Content):** The 'Key Observations' section is for **textual insights only**. You **MUST NOT** include raw data, code blocks (like SQL), or titles for data that is presented elsewhere (e.g., 'DDL for table_x:'). Your observations should be narrative sentences that describe what the data means.


--- History (History Disabled for LLM Call: False) ---
[user]: You are a helpful assistant.
[model]: Understood.
[user]: SYSTEM PROMPT:

# Core Directives
You are a specialized assistant for a Teradata database system. Your primary goal is to fulfill user requests by selecting the best capability (a tool or a prompt) from the categorized lists provided and supplying all necessary arguments.

# Response Format
Your response MUST be a single JSON object for a tool/prompt call OR a single plain text string for a final answer.

1.  **Tool/Prompt Calls (JSON format):**
    -   If the capability is a prompt, you MUST use the key `"prompt_name"`.
    -   If the capability is a tool, you MUST use the key `"tool_name"`.
    -   Provide all required arguments. Infer values from the conversation history if necessary.
    -   Example (Prompt): `{"prompt_name": "some_prompt", "arguments": {"arg": "value"}}`
    -   Example (Tool): `{"tool_name": "some_tool", "arguments": {"arg": "value"}}`

2.  **Final Answer (Plain Text format):**
    -   When you have sufficient information to fully answer the user's request, you MUST stop using tools.
    -   Your response MUST begin with the exact prefix `FINAL_ANSWER:`, followed by a natural language summary.
    -   Example: `FINAL_ANSWER: I found 48 databases on the system. The details are displayed below.`

# Decision Process
To select the correct capability, you MUST follow this two-step process, governed by one critical rule:

**CRITICAL RULE: Follow this strict hierarchy for capability selection:**
1.  **Prioritize Pre-defined Analysis/Reports (Prompts):** If the user's request is for an **analysis, description, or summary** that is a strong semantic match for an available `prompt`, you **MUST** select that `prompt_name`. Prompts are the preferred method for generating these pre-defined analytical outputs.
2.  **Default to Direct Actions (Tools):** If no analytical prompt is a direct match, or if the user's request is a direct command (e.g., "list...", "count...", "show me..."), you **MUST** treat the request as a direct action. Select the most specific `tool_name` that fulfills this action.

**CRITICAL RULE (Planner Efficiency):** You **MUST NOT** create a multi-phase plan using tools if the user's goal can be fully achieved by a single, available prompt. If a prompt exists that matches the user's request for an analysis or report, you **MUST** call that prompt directly. Do not create a plan that manually replicates the function of an existing prompt.

# Few-Shot Examples
Here are examples of the correct thinking process:

**Example 1: Direct Action Request**
- **User Query:** "what is the quality of table 'online' in database 'DEMO_Customer360_db'?"
- **Thought Process:**
    1. The user's request is about "quality," but it's a direct question, not a request for a broad "description" or "summary." No prompt for a pre-defined analysis is a perfect match.
    2. Therefore, I move to step 2 of my critical rule: treat this as a direct action.
    3. The user's query is about a **table**. I must choose a table-level tool.
    4. The `qlty_columnSummary` tool takes a `table_name` and is the most specific, correct choice for this direct action.
- **Correct Response:** `{"tool_name": "qlty_columnSummary", "arguments": {"database_name": "DEMO_Customer360_db", "table_name": "online"}}`

**Example 2: Pre-defined Analysis Request**
- **User Query:** "describe the business purpose of the 'DEMO_Customer360_db' database"
- **Thought Process:**
    1. The user's request is for a "business purpose" description, which is a pre-defined analysis. I will check for a matching prompt first.
    2. The `base_databaseBusinessDesc` prompt is described as being for this exact purpose. It is a strong semantic match.
    3. According to my critical rule, I **MUST** select this prompt. I am forbidden from creating a multi-step plan to get the DDL and then summarize it.
- **Correct Response:** `{"prompt_name": "base_databaseBusinessDesc", "arguments": {"database_name": "DEMO_Customer360_db"}}`

# Best Practices
- **Context is Key:** Always use information from previous turns to fill in arguments like `database_name` or `table_name`.
- **Error Recovery:** If a tool fails, analyze the error message and attempt to call the tool again with corrected parameters. Only ask the user for clarification if you cannot recover.
- **SQL Generation:** When using the `base_readQuery` tool, you MUST use fully qualified table names in your SQL (e.g., `SELECT ... FROM my_database.my_table`).
- **Time-Sensitive Queries:** For queries involving relative dates (e.g., 'today', 'this week'), you MUST use the `util_getCurrentDate` tool first to determine the current date before proceeding.
- **Out of Scope:** If the user's request is unrelated to the available capabilities, respond with a `FINAL_ANSWER:` that politely explains you cannot fulfill the request and restates your purpose.
- **CRITICAL: Avoid Repetitive Behavior.** You are a highly intelligent agent. Do not get stuck in a loop by repeating the same tool calls or by cycling through the same set of tools. Once a tool has returned a successful result with data that is relevant to the user's request, do not call that same tool again unless there is a new and compelling reason to do so. If you have called a series of tools and believe you have enough information, you must call a FINAL_ANSWER. Do not repeat tool calls just to be "through".

USER PROMPT:

You are an expert strategic planning assistant. Your task is to analyze a user's request or a complex workflow goal and decompose it into a high-level, phased meta-plan. This plan will serve as a state machine executor.

---
### Critical Directives
You MUST follow these directives in order to create a valid and efficient plan.



1.  **Analyze Goal and Context**: First, carefully read the user's `GOAL` and review the `CONTEXT` section to understand the full intent and what actions have already been taken.
    
    

2.  **Identify Conversational Turns**: If the user's `GOAL` is purely conversational (e.g., a greeting like "hello") and does not require any data or action, your response **MUST be a single JSON object**: `{"plan_type": "conversational", "response": "I'm doing well, thank you for asking! How can I help you with your Teradata database system today?"}`.

3.  **Handle Context and Parameters Correctly**:
    * **Prioritize the Goal**: You **MUST** prioritize entities from the user's current `GOAL` over conflicting information in the `Workflow History`. The history is for supplementing missing information, not for overriding the current request.
    * **Extract Parameters**: You **MUST** meticulously scan the `GOAL` for entities that correspond to tool arguments (e.g., table names) and populate the `"arguments"` block in your plan phase with these key-value pairs.

4.  **Follow the Plan Architecture**:
    * Your plan **MUST** follow a strict "data-gathering first, synthesis last" architecture.
    * If the goal requires a final summary, the plan **MUST** conclude with a single phase that uses the `CoreLLMTask` tool. The `task_description` for this phase **MUST** be the complete and verbatim text of the main `GOAL` to ensure all original context is preserved.

5.  **Optimize for Efficiency**:
    * Your plan **MUST** be as efficient as possible. Combine multiple steps into a single phase if one tool can perform the combined operation.
    * **CRITICAL STRATEGY (Query Pushdown Efficiency)**: Always prefer a single action that filters data at the source over multiple steps that retrieve unfiltered data and then filter it.
        * **HIGHLY PREFERRED:** Use a tool that accepts a filter (e.g., a `sql` parameter with a `WHERE` clause) to request *only the specific data you need*.
        * **AVOID IF POSSIBLE:** Do not use a general-purpose "list" tool and then follow it with a second phase to find a specific item.

6.  **Maintain Simplicity and Focus**:
    * If the `GOAL` can be answered with a single tool call, your plan **MUST** consist of only that single phase. Do not add unnecessary synthesis phases for simple data retrieval.
    * Every phase **MUST** correspond to a concrete, executable action. Do **NOT** create phases for simple verification or acknowledgement.

7.  **Adhere to Structural Rules**:
    * **CRITICAL RULE (Plan Flattening)**: Your plan **MUST ALWAYS** be a flat, sequential list of phases. You **MUST NOT** create nested structures. Decompose tasks with nested logic into multiple, sequential looping phases.
    * **CRITICAL RULE (Capability Type Enforcement)**: Your selection **MUST** strictly adhere to the capability type. You are **forbidden** from placing a `(prompt)` in the `"relevant_tools"` list or a `(tool)` in the `"executable_prompt"` field.

8.  **Ensure Stability**:
    * **CRITICAL RULE (Recursion Prevention)**: Review the `Current Execution Depth`. You **MUST NOT** create a plan that calls an `executable_prompt` if the depth is approaching the maximum of 5. If you are already inside an `Active Prompt`, you **MUST NOT** create a plan that calls that same prompt again.

---
### Plan JSON Structure
Your output **MUST** be a single, valid JSON array of phase objects. Each object must follow this structure:

-   `"phase"`: An integer, starting from 1.
-   `"goal"`: A concise string describing what this phase will accomplish. You MUST embed any relevant parameters from the user's goal directly into this string.
-   `"type"`: (Optional) Use `"loop"` if the phase needs to iterate over the results of a previous phase.
-   `"loop_over"`: (Required if `type` is `"loop"`) A string identifying the source of items to loop over (e.g., `"result_of_phase_1"`).
-   `"relevant_tools"`: A JSON array containing the single string name of the `(tool)` to be used in this phase.
-   `"executable_prompt"`: A string name of the `(prompt)` to be used in this phase.
-   `"arguments"`: (Optional) A JSON object of key-value pairs for the selected capability. You can use placeholders like `"result_of_phase_1"` to pass data between phases.

### EXAMPLE (Flattening Nested Logic)
-   **User Goal**: "For each database on the system, get the DDL for all of its tables."
-   **Correct Plan**:
    ```json
    [
      {
        "phase": 1,
        "goal": "First, get a list of all databases on the system.",
        "relevant_tools": ["base_listDatabases"]
      },
      {
        "phase": 2,
        "goal": "Now, loop over the list of databases gathered in Phase 1 and get the list of tables for each one.",
        "type": "loop",
        "loop_over": "result_of_phase_1",
        "relevant_tools": ["base_listTables"]
      },
      {
        "phase": 3,
        "goal": "Finally, loop over the flattened list of tables gathered in Phase 2 and get the DDL for each one.",
        "type": "loop",
        "loop_over": "result_of_phase_2",
        "relevant_tools": ["base_tableDDL"]
      }
    ]

### Context for this Plan
-   Overall Goal: `is there a fitness database on the system`
-   Explicit Parameters: 
-   User's Original Input: `is there a fitness database on the system`
-   Workflow History: `[]`
-   Execution Depth: This is recursive call number `0`. Avoid creating identical plans.


Your response MUST be a single, valid JSON list of phase objects. Do NOT add any extra text, conversation, or markdown.

[user]: SYSTEM PROMPT:
You are a text processing and synthesis assistant.

USER PROMPT:
You are a highly capable text processing and synthesis assistant.

--- PRIMARY GOAL ---
Your most important task is to directly answer the user's original question: 'is there a fitness database on the system'.
You MUST begin your response with the direct answer. Do not repeat the user's question or use conversational intros like 'Here is...'. After providing the direct answer, you may then proceed with a more general summary or analysis of the data.

--- TASK ---

You are an expert data analyst. Your task is to create a final report for the user based on the provided data and their original question.

--- INSTRUCTIONS ---
Your entire response MUST be formatted in standard markdown and MUST be structured as follows:

1.  **(Optional) Key Metric:** If the answer to the user's question can be summarized by a single primary value (either quantitative like a number, or qualitative like a status), you MUST provide it on the very first line in a specific JSON format. The line must start with `Key Metric: ` followed by a JSON object with a `value` (as a string) and a `label` (a short description).
    - Quantitative Example: `Key Metric: {"value": "21", "label": "Databases on system"}`
    - Qualitative Example: `Key Metric: {"value": "High", "label": "System Utilization"}`
    If there is no single primary value, you MUST omit this line entirely.
2.  **The Direct Answer:** This part MUST immediately follow the Key Metric (or be the first line if no metric is provided). It must be a single, concise sentence that directly and factually answers the user's question.
3.  **Key Observations:** This section MUST start with a level-2 markdown heading (`## Key Observations`). It should contain a bulleted list of all supporting details and context.
4.  **CRITICAL RULE (Observations Content):** The 'Key Observations' section is for **textual insights only**. You **MUST NOT** include raw data, code blocks (like SQL), or titles for data that is presented elsewhere (e.g., 'DDL for table_x:'). Your observations should be narrative sentences that describe what the data means.

--- KNOWN CONTEXT ---
The following key information has already been established in previous steps. You MUST use this information to populate header fields like 'Table Name' or 'Database Name'.
None

--- SEMANTIC GUIDANCE ---
When the 'TASK' asks for a 'description', 'analysis', or 'summary', you MUST synthesize new content that reflects the *semantic intent* of the request.
For example:
- If the 'TASK' asks for a 'business description of a table', you MUST explain its purpose from an organizational, functional, or analytical viewpoint, and the business significance of its columns. Do NOT simply reiterate technical DDL (Data Definition Language) information, even if it is present in the `RELEVANT DATA`.
- If the 'TASK' asks for a 'summary of errors', you MUST provide a concise overview of the issues, not just a list of error codes.
Always prioritize generating content that matches the *meaning* and *purpose* of the 'TASK', interpreting the raw data to produce the desired semantic output.

--- CRITICAL RULES ---
1. **Separate Data from Description:** If the 'TASK' requires you to output header fields (like `***Table Name:***` or `***Database Name:***`) AND a main description, you MUST treat these as separate steps. First, populate the header fields using the 'KNOWN CONTEXT'. Then, write the main description. Do NOT merge context data (like the database name) into a single header field.
2. **Content and Formatting Precision:** You MUST adhere to any and all formatting instructions contained in the 'TASK' description with absolute precision. Do not deviate, simplify, or change the requested format in any way. You MUST generate content that genuinely fulfills the semantic goal of the 'TASK'.
3. **Key Name Adherence:** If the 'TASK' description provides an example format, you MUST use the exact key names (e.g., `***Description:***`, `***Table Name:***`) shown in the example. Do not invent new key names or use synonyms like 'Table Description'.
4. **Column Placeholder Replacement:** If the 'TASK' involves describing table columns and the formatting guidelines include a placeholder like `***ColumnX:***` or `***[Column Name]:***`, you MUST replace that placeholder with the actual name of the column you are describing (e.g., `***CUST_ID:***`, `***FIRSTNAME:***`). Do not use generic, numbered placeholders like 'Column1', 'Column2', etc.
5. **Layout and Line Breaks:** Each key-value pair or list item specified in the formatting guidelines MUST be on its own separate line. Do not combine multiple items onto a single line.

Your response should be the direct result of the task. Do not add any conversational text or extra formatting unless explicitly requested by the task description.
[model]: Key Metric: {"value": "true", "label": "Fitness database exists"}
Yes, there is a fitness database on the system.

## Key Observations
*   The `base_databaseList` tool returned a list of 47 databases.
*   One of the databases in the list is named `fitness_db` and is of type `DataBase`.
*   The `fitness_db` database has a comment string value of `None`.
[user]: SYSTEM PROMPT:

# Core Directives
You are a specialized assistant for a Teradata database system. Your primary goal is to fulfill user requests by selecting the best capability (a tool or a prompt) from the categorized lists provided and supplying all necessary arguments.

# Response Format
Your response MUST be a single JSON object for a tool/prompt call OR a single plain text string for a final answer.

1.  **Tool/Prompt Calls (JSON format):**
    -   If the capability is a prompt, you MUST use the key `"prompt_name"`.
    -   If the capability is a tool, you MUST use the key `"tool_name"`.
    -   Provide all required arguments. Infer values from the conversation history if necessary.
    -   Example (Prompt): `{"prompt_name": "some_prompt", "arguments": {"arg": "value"}}`
    -   Example (Tool): `{"tool_name": "some_tool", "arguments": {"arg": "value"}}`

2.  **Final Answer (Plain Text format):**
    -   When you have sufficient information to fully answer the user's request, you MUST stop using tools.
    -   Your response MUST begin with the exact prefix `FINAL_ANSWER:`, followed by a natural language summary.
    -   Example: `FINAL_ANSWER: I found 48 databases on the system. The details are displayed below.`

# Decision Process
To select the correct capability, you MUST follow this two-step process, governed by one critical rule:

**CRITICAL RULE: Follow this strict hierarchy for capability selection:**
1.  **Prioritize Pre-defined Analysis/Reports (Prompts):** If the user's request is for an **analysis, description, or summary** that is a strong semantic match for an available `prompt`, you **MUST** select that `prompt_name`. Prompts are the preferred method for generating these pre-defined analytical outputs.
2.  **Default to Direct Actions (Tools):** If no analytical prompt is a direct match, or if the user's request is a direct command (e.g., "list...", "count...", "show me..."), you **MUST** treat the request as a direct action. Select the most specific `tool_name` that fulfills this action.

**CRITICAL RULE (Planner Efficiency):** You **MUST NOT** create a multi-phase plan using tools if the user's goal can be fully achieved by a single, available prompt. If a prompt exists that matches the user's request for an analysis or report, you **MUST** call that prompt directly. Do not create a plan that manually replicates the function of an existing prompt.

# Few-Shot Examples
Here are examples of the correct thinking process:

**Example 1: Direct Action Request**
- **User Query:** "what is the quality of table 'online' in database 'DEMO_Customer360_db'?"
- **Thought Process:**
    1. The user's request is about "quality," but it's a direct question, not a request for a broad "description" or "summary." No prompt for a pre-defined analysis is a perfect match.
    2. Therefore, I move to step 2 of my critical rule: treat this as a direct action.
    3. The user's query is about a **table**. I must choose a table-level tool.
    4. The `qlty_columnSummary` tool takes a `table_name` and is the most specific, correct choice for this direct action.
- **Correct Response:** `{"tool_name": "qlty_columnSummary", "arguments": {"database_name": "DEMO_Customer360_db", "table_name": "online"}}`

**Example 2: Pre-defined Analysis Request**
- **User Query:** "describe the business purpose of the 'DEMO_Customer360_db' database"
- **Thought Process:**
    1. The user's request is for a "business purpose" description, which is a pre-defined analysis. I will check for a matching prompt first.
    2. The `base_databaseBusinessDesc` prompt is described as being for this exact purpose. It is a strong semantic match.
    3. According to my critical rule, I **MUST** select this prompt. I am forbidden from creating a multi-step plan to get the DDL and then summarize it.
- **Correct Response:** `{"prompt_name": "base_databaseBusinessDesc", "arguments": {"database_name": "DEMO_Customer360_db"}}`

# Best Practices
- **Context is Key:** Always use information from previous turns to fill in arguments like `database_name` or `table_name`.
- **Error Recovery:** If a tool fails, analyze the error message and attempt to call the tool again with corrected parameters. Only ask the user for clarification if you cannot recover.
- **SQL Generation:** When using the `base_readQuery` tool, you MUST use fully qualified table names in your SQL (e.g., `SELECT ... FROM my_database.my_table`).
- **Time-Sensitive Queries:** For queries involving relative dates (e.g., 'today', 'this week'), you MUST use the `util_getCurrentDate` tool first to determine the current date before proceeding.
- **Out of Scope:** If the user's request is unrelated to the available capabilities, respond with a `FINAL_ANSWER:` that politely explains you cannot fulfill the request and restates your purpose.
- **CRITICAL: Avoid Repetitive Behavior.** You are a highly intelligent agent. Do not get stuck in a loop by repeating the same tool calls or by cycling through the same set of tools. Once a tool has returned a successful result with data that is relevant to the user's request, do not call that same tool again unless there is a new and compelling reason to do so. If you have called a series of tools and believe you have enough information, you must call a FINAL_ANSWER. Do not repeat tool calls just to be "through".

USER PROMPT:

You are an expert strategic planning assistant. Your task is to analyze a user's request or a complex workflow goal and decompose it into a high-level, phased meta-plan. This plan will serve as a state machine executor.

---
### Critical Directives
You MUST follow these directives in order to create a valid and efficient plan.



1.  **Analyze Goal and Context**: First, carefully read the user's `GOAL` and review the `CONTEXT` section to understand the full intent and what actions have already been taken.
    
    

2.  **Identify Conversational Turns**: If the user's `GOAL` is purely conversational (e.g., a greeting like "hello") and does not require any data or action, your response **MUST be a single JSON object**: `{"plan_type": "conversational", "response": "I'm doing well, thank you for asking! How can I help you with your Teradata database system today?"}`.

3.  **Handle Context and Parameters Correctly**:
    * **Prioritize the Goal**: You **MUST** prioritize entities from the user's current `GOAL` over conflicting information in the `Workflow History`. The history is for supplementing missing information, not for overriding the current request.
    * **Extract Parameters**: You **MUST** meticulously scan the `GOAL` for entities that correspond to tool arguments (e.g., table names) and populate the `"arguments"` block in your plan phase with these key-value pairs.

4.  **Follow the Plan Architecture**:
    * Your plan **MUST** follow a strict "data-gathering first, synthesis last" architecture.
    * If the goal requires a final summary, the plan **MUST** conclude with a single phase that uses the `CoreLLMTask` tool. The `task_description` for this phase **MUST** be the complete and verbatim text of the main `GOAL` to ensure all original context is preserved.

5.  **Optimize for Efficiency**:
    * Your plan **MUST** be as efficient as possible. Combine multiple steps into a single phase if one tool can perform the combined operation.
    * **CRITICAL STRATEGY (Query Pushdown Efficiency)**: Always prefer a single action that filters data at the source over multiple steps that retrieve unfiltered data and then filter it.
        * **HIGHLY PREFERRED:** Use a tool that accepts a filter (e.g., a `sql` parameter with a `WHERE` clause) to request *only the specific data you need*.
        * **AVOID IF POSSIBLE:** Do not use a general-purpose "list" tool and then follow it with a second phase to find a specific item.

6.  **Maintain Simplicity and Focus**:
    * If the `GOAL` can be answered with a single tool call, your plan **MUST** consist of only that single phase. Do not add unnecessary synthesis phases for simple data retrieval.
    * Every phase **MUST** correspond to a concrete, executable action. Do **NOT** create phases for simple verification or acknowledgement.

7.  **Adhere to Structural Rules**:
    * **CRITICAL RULE (Plan Flattening)**: Your plan **MUST ALWAYS** be a flat, sequential list of phases. You **MUST NOT** create nested structures. Decompose tasks with nested logic into multiple, sequential looping phases.
    * **CRITICAL RULE (Capability Type Enforcement)**: Your selection **MUST** strictly adhere to the capability type. You are **forbidden** from placing a `(prompt)` in the `"relevant_tools"` list or a `(tool)` in the `"executable_prompt"` field.

8.  **Ensure Stability**:
    * **CRITICAL RULE (Recursion Prevention)**: Review the `Current Execution Depth`. You **MUST NOT** create a plan that calls an `executable_prompt` if the depth is approaching the maximum of 5. If you are already inside an `Active Prompt`, you **MUST NOT** create a plan that calls that same prompt again.

---
### Plan JSON Structure
Your output **MUST** be a single, valid JSON array of phase objects. Each object must follow this structure:

-   `"phase"`: An integer, starting from 1.
-   `"goal"`: A concise string describing what this phase will accomplish. You MUST embed any relevant parameters from the user's goal directly into this string.
-   `"type"`: (Optional) Use `"loop"` if the phase needs to iterate over the results of a previous phase.
-   `"loop_over"`: (Required if `type` is `"loop"`) A string identifying the source of items to loop over (e.g., `"result_of_phase_1"`).
-   `"relevant_tools"`: A JSON array containing the single string name of the `(tool)` to be used in this phase.
-   `"executable_prompt"`: A string name of the `(prompt)` to be used in this phase.
-   `"arguments"`: (Optional) A JSON object of key-value pairs for the selected capability. You can use placeholders like `"result_of_phase_1"` to pass data between phases.

---
### EXAMPLE (Flattening Nested Logic)
-   **User Goal**: "For each database on the system, get the DDL for all of its tables."
-   **Correct Plan**:
    ```json
    [
      {
        "phase": 1,
        "goal": "First, get a list of all databases on the system.",
        "relevant_tools": ["base_listDatabases"]
      },
      {
        "phase": 2,
        "goal": "Now, loop over the list of databases gathered in Phase 1 and get the list of tables for each one.",
        "type": "loop",
        "loop_over": "result_of_phase_1",
        "relevant_tools": ["base_listTables"]
      },
      {
        "phase": 3,
        "goal": "Finally, loop over the flattened list of tables gathered in Phase 2 and get the DDL for each one.",
        "type": "loop",
        "loop_over": "result_of_phase_2",
        "relevant_tools": ["base_tableDDL"]
      }
    ]

Your task is to create a final report for the user based on the provided data and their original question.\n\n--- INSTRUCTIONS ---\nYour entire response MUST be formatted in standard markdown and MUST be structured as follows:\n\n1.  **(Optional) Key Metric:** If the answer to the user's question can be summarized by a single primary value (either quantitative like a number, or qualitative like a status), you MUST provide it on the very first line in a specific JSON format. The line must start with `Key Metric: ` followed by a JSON object with a `value` (as a string) and a `label` (a short description).\n    - Quantitative Example: `Key Metric: {\"value\": \"21\", \"label\": \"Databases on system\"}`\n    - Qualitative Example: `Key Metric: {\"value\": \"High\", \"label\": \"System Utilization\"}`\n    If there is no single primary value, you MUST omit this line entirely.\n2.  **The Direct Answer:** This part MUST immediately follow the Key Metric (or be the first line if no metric is provided). It must be a single, concise sentence that directly and factually answers the user's question.\n3.  **Key Observations:** This section MUST start with a level-2 markdown heading (`## Key Observations`). It should contain a bulleted list of all supporting details and context.\n4.  **CRITICAL RULE (Observations Content):** The 'Key Observations' section is for **textual insights only**. You **MUST NOT** include raw data, code blocks (like SQL), or titles for data that is presented elsewhere (e.g., 'DDL for table_x:'). Your observations should be narrative sentences that describe what the data means.\n",

The line must start with `Key Metric: ` followed by a JSON object with a `value` (as a string) and a `label` (a short description).\n    - Quantitative Example: `Key Metric: {\"value\": \"21\", \"label\": \"Databases on system\"}`\n    - Qualitative Example: `Key Metric: {\"value\": \"High\", \"label\": \"System Utilization\"}`\n    If there is no single primary value, you MUST omit this line entirely.\n2.  **The Direct Answer:** This part MUST immediately follow the Key Metric (or be the first line if no metric is provided). It must be a single, concise sentence that directly and factually answers the user's question.\n3.  **Key Observations:** This section MUST start with a level-2 markdown heading (`## Key Observations`). It should contain a bulleted list of all supporting details and context.\n4.  **CRITICAL RULE (Observations Content):** The 'Key Observations' section is for **textual insights only**. You **MUST NOT** include raw data, code blocks (like SQL), or titles for data that is presented elsewhere (e.g., 'DDL for table_x:'). Your observations should be narrative sentences that describe what the data means.\n",

[user]: SYSTEM PROMPT:
You are a text processing and synthesis assistant.

USER PROMPT:
You are a highly capable text processing and synthesis assistant.

--- PRIMARY GOAL ---
Your most important task is to directly answer the user's original question: 'what is the detailed physical database to sign off the fitness database'.
You MUST begin your response with the direct answer. Do not repeat the user's question or use conversational intros like 'Here is...'. After providing the direct answer, you may then proceed with a more general summary or analysis of the data.

--- TASK ---

You are an expert data analyst. Your task is to create a final report for the user based on the provided data and their original question.

--- INSTRUCTIONS ---
Your entire response MUST be formatted in standard markdown and MUST be structured as follows:

1.  **(Optional) Key Metric:** If the answer to the user's question can be summarized by a single primary value (either quantitative like a number, or qualitative like a status), you MUST provide it on the very first line in a specific JSON format. The line must start with `Key Metric: ` followed by a JSON object with a `value` (as a string) and a `label` (a short description).
    - Quantitative Example: `Key Metric: {"value": "21", "label": "Databases on system"}`
    - Qualitative Example: `Key Metric: {"value": "High", "label": "System Utilization"}`
    If there is no single primary value, you MUST omit this line entirely.
2.  **The Direct Answer:** This part MUST immediately follow the Key Metric (or be the first line if no metric is provided). It must be a single, concise sentence that directly and factually answers the user's question.
3.  **Key Observations:** This section MUST start with a level-2 markdown heading (`## Key Observations`). It should contain a bulleted list of all supporting details and context.
4.  **CRITICAL RULE (Observations Content):** The 'Key Observations' section is for **textual insights only**. You **MUST NOT** include raw data, code blocks (like SQL), or titles for data that is presented elsewhere (e.g., 'DDL for table_x:'). Your observations should be narrative sentences that describe what the data means.

--- KNOWN CONTEXT ---
The following key information has already been established in previous steps. You MUST use this information to populate header fields like 'Table Name' or 'Database Name'.
None

--- SEMANTIC GUIDANCE ---
When the 'TASK' asks for a 'description', 'analysis', or 'summary', you MUST synthesize new content that reflects the *semantic intent* of the request.
For example:
- If the 'TASK' asks for a 'business description of a table', you MUST explain its purpose from an organizational, functional, or analytical viewpoint, and the business significance of its columns. Do NOT simply reiterate technical DDL (Data Definition Language) information, even if it is present in the `RELEVANT DATA`.
- If the 'TASK' asks for a 'summary of errors', you MUST provide a concise overview of the issues, not just a list of error codes.
Always prioritize generating content that matches the *meaning* and *purpose* of the 'TASK', interpreting the raw data to produce the desired semantic output.

--- CRITICAL RULES ---
1. **Separate Data from Description:** If the 'TASK' requires you to output header fields (like `***Table Name:***` or `***Database Name:***`) AND a main description, you MUST treat these as separate steps. First, populate the header fields using the 'KNOWN CONTEXT'. Then, write the main description. Do NOT merge context data (like the database name) into a single header field.
2. **Content and Formatting Precision:** You MUST adhere to any and all formatting instructions contained in the 'TASK' description with absolute precision. Do not deviate, simplify, or change the requested format in any way. You MUST generate content that genuinely fulfills the semantic goal of the 'TASK'.
3. **Key Name Adherence:** If the 'TASK' description provides an example format, you MUST use the exact key names (e.g., `***Description:***`, `***Table Name:***`) shown in the example. Do not invent new key names or use synonyms like 'Table Description'.
4. **Column Placeholder Replacement:** If the 'TASK' involves describing table columns and the formatting guidelines include a placeholder like `***ColumnX:***` or `***[Column Name]:***`, you MUST replace that placeholder with the actual name of the column you are describing (e.g., `***CUST_ID:***`, `***FIRSTNAME:***`). Do not use generic, numbered placeholders like 'Column1', 'Column2', etc.
5. **Layout and Line Breaks:** Each key-value pair or list item specified in the formatting guidelines MUST be on its own separate line. Do not combine multiple items onto a single line.

Your response should be the direct result of the task. Do not add any conversational text or extra formatting unless explicitly requested by the task description.

[user]: SYSTEM PROMPT:

# Core Directives
You are a specialized assistant for a Teradata database system. Your primary goal is to fulfill user requests by selecting the best capability (a tool or a prompt) from the categorized lists provided and supplying all necessary arguments.

# Response Format
Your response MUST be a single JSON object for a tool/prompt call OR a single plain text string for a final answer.

1.  **Tool/Prompt Calls (JSON format):**
    -   If the capability is a prompt, you MUST use the key `"prompt_name"`.
    -   If the capability is a tool, you MUST use the key `"tool_name"`.
    -   Provide all required arguments. Infer values from the conversation history if necessary.
    -   Example (Prompt): `{"prompt_name": "some_prompt", "arguments": {"arg": "value"}}`
    -   Example (Tool): `{"tool_name": "some_tool", "arguments": {"arg": "value"}}`

2.  **Final Answer (Plain Text format):**
    -   When you have sufficient information to fully answer the user's request, you MUST stop using tools.
    -   Your response MUST begin with the exact prefix `FINAL_ANSWER:`, followed by a natural language summary.
    -   Example: `FINAL_ANSWER: I found 48 databases on the system. The details are displayed below.`

# Decision Process
To select the correct capability, you MUST follow this two-step process, governed by one critical rule:

**CRITICAL RULE: Follow this strict hierarchy for capability selection:**
1.  **Prioritize Pre-defined Analysis/Reports (Prompts):** If the user's request is for an **analysis, description, or summary** that is a strong semantic match for an available `prompt`, you **MUST** select that `prompt_name`. Prompts are the preferred method for generating these pre-defined analytical outputs.
2.  **Default to Direct Actions (Tools):** If no analytical prompt is a direct match, or if the user's request is a direct command (e.g., "list...", "count...", "show me..."), you **MUST** treat the request as a direct action. Select the most specific `tool_name` that fulfills this action.

**CRITICAL RULE (Planner Efficiency):** You **MUST NOT** create a multi-phase plan using tools if the user's goal can be fully achieved by a single, available prompt. If a prompt exists that matches the user's request for an analysis or report, you **MUST** call that prompt directly. Do not create a plan that manually replicates the function of an existing prompt.

# Few-Shot Examples
Here are examples of the correct thinking process:

**Example 1: Direct Action Request**
- **User Query:** "what is the quality of table 'online' in database 'DEMO_Customer360_db'?"
- **Thought Process:**
    1. The user's request is about "quality," but it's a direct question, not a request for a broad "description" or "summary." No prompt for a pre-defined analysis is a perfect match.
    2. Therefore, I move to step 2 of my critical rule: treat this as a direct action.
    3. The user's query is about a **table**. I must choose a table-level tool.
    4. The `qlty_columnSummary` tool takes a `table_name` and is the most specific, correct choice for this direct action.
- **Correct Response:** `{"tool_name": "qlty_columnSummary", "arguments": {"database_name": "DEMO_Customer360_db", "table_name": "online"}}`

**Example 2: Pre-defined Analysis Request**
- **User Query:** "describe the business purpose of the 'DEMO_Customer360_db' database"
- **Thought Process:**
    1. The user's request is for a "business purpose" description, which is a pre-defined analysis. I will check for a matching prompt first.
    2. The `base_databaseBusinessDesc` prompt is described as being for this exact purpose. It is a strong semantic match.
    3. According to my critical rule, I **MUST** select this prompt. I am forbidden from creating a multi-step plan to get the DDL and then summarize it.
- **Correct Response:** `{"prompt_name": "base_databaseBusinessDesc", "arguments": {"database_name": "DEMO_Customer360_db"}}`

# Best Practices
- **Context is Key:** Always use information from previous turns to fill in arguments like `database_name` or `table_name`.
- **Error Recovery:** If a tool fails, analyze the error message and attempt to call the tool again with corrected parameters. Only ask the user for clarification if you cannot recover.
- **SQL Generation:** When using the `base_readQuery` tool, you MUST use fully qualified table names in your SQL (e.g., `SELECT ... FROM my_database.my_table`).
- **Time-Sensitive Queries:** For queries involving relative dates (e.g., 'today', 'this week'), you MUST use the `util_getCurrentDate` tool first to determine the current date before proceeding.
- **Out of Scope:** If the user's request is unrelated to the available capabilities, respond with a `FINAL_ANSWER:` that politely explains you cannot fulfill the request and restates your purpose.
- **CRITICAL: Avoid Repetitive Behavior.** You are a highly intelligent agent. Do not get stuck in a loop by repeating the same tool calls or by cycling through the same set of tools. Once a tool has returned a successful result with data that is relevant to the user's request, do not call that same tool again unless there is a new and compelling reason to do so. If you have called a series of tools and believe you have enough information, you must call a FINAL_ANSWER. Do not repeat tool calls just to be "through".

    - `argument` (string, required): Argument
- `viz_createChart` (tool): Generates a data visualization based on provided data. You must specify the chart type and map the data fields to the appropriate visual roles.
  - Arguments:
    - `chart_type` (string, required): The type of chart to generate (e.g., 'bar', 'pie', 'line', 'scatter'). This MUST be one of the types listed in the 'Charting Guidelines'.
    - `data` (list[dict], required): The data to be visualized, passed directly from the output of another tool.
    - `title` (string, required): A descriptive title for the chart.
    - `mapping` (dict, required): A dictionary that maps data keys to chart axes or roles (e.g., {'x_axis': 'product_name', 'y_axis': 'sales_total'}). The required keys for this mapping depend on the selected chart_type.
- `util_getCurrentDate` (tool): Returns the current system date in YYYY-MM-DD format. Use this as the first step for any user query involving relative dates like 'today', 'yesterday', or 'this week'.
- `util_calculateDateRange` (tool): Calculates a list of dates based on a start date and a natural language phrase (e.g., 'past 3 days', 'last week'). This is a necessary second step for multi-day queries.
  - Arguments:
    - `start_date` (string, required): The anchor date for the calculation, usually today's date from `util_getCurrentDate`. Must be in YYYY-MM-DD format.
    - `date_phrase` (string, required): The natural language phrase describing the desired range (e.g., 'past 3 days', 'last 2 weeks').

USER PROMPT:

You are an expert strategic planning assistant. Your task is to analyze a user's request or a complex workflow goal and decompose it into a high-level, phased meta-plan. This plan will serve as a state machine executor.

---
### Critical Directives
You MUST follow these directives in order to create a valid and efficient plan.



1.  **Analyze Goal and Context**: First, carefully read the user's `GOAL` and review the `CONTEXT` section to understand the full intent and what actions have already been taken.
    
    

2.  **Identify Conversational Turns**: If the user's `GOAL` is purely conversational (e.g., a greeting like "hello") and does not require any data or action, your response **MUST be a single JSON object**: `{"plan_type": "conversational", "response": "I'm doing well, thank you for asking! How can I help you with your Teradata database system today?"}`.

3.  **Handle Context and Parameters Correctly**:
    * **Prioritize the Goal**: You **MUST** prioritize entities from the user's current `GOAL` over conflicting information in the `Workflow History`. The history is for supplementing missing information, not for overriding the current request.
    * **Extract Parameters**: You **MUST** meticulously scan the `GOAL` for entities that correspond to tool arguments (e.g., table names) and populate the `"arguments"` block in your plan phase with these key-value pairs.

4.  **Follow the Plan Architecture**:
    * Your plan **MUST** follow a strict "data-gathering first, synthesis last" architecture.
    * If the goal requires a final summary, the plan **MUST** conclude with a single phase that uses the `CoreLLMTask` tool. The `task_description` for this phase **MUST** be the complete and verbatim text of the main `GOAL` to ensure all original context is preserved.

5.  **Optimize for Efficiency**:
    * Your plan **MUST** be as efficient as possible. Combine multiple steps into a single phase if one tool can perform the combined operation.
    * **CRITICAL STRATEGY (Query Pushdown Efficiency)**: Always prefer a single action that filters data at the source over multiple steps that retrieve unfiltered data and then filter it.
        * **HIGHLY PREFERRED:** Use a tool that accepts a filter (e.g., a `sql` parameter with a `WHERE` clause) to request *only the specific data you need*.
        * **AVOID IF POSSIBLE:** Do not use a general-purpose "list" tool and then follow it with a second phase to find a specific item.

6.  **Maintain Simplicity and Focus**:
    * If the `GOAL` can be answered with a single tool call, your plan **MUST** consist of only that single phase. Do not add unnecessary synthesis phases for simple data retrieval.
    * Every phase **MUST** correspond to a concrete, executable action. Do **NOT** create phases for simple verification or acknowledgement.

7.  **Adhere to Structural Rules**:
    * **CRITICAL RULE (Plan Flattening)**: Your plan **MUST ALWAYS** be a flat, sequential list of phases. You **MUST NOT** create nested structures. Decompose tasks with nested logic into multiple, sequential looping phases.
    * **CRITICAL RULE (Capability Type Enforcement)**: Your selection **MUST** strictly adhere to the capability type. You are **forbidden** from placing a `(prompt)` in the `"relevant_tools"` list or a `(tool)` in the `"executable_prompt"` field.

8.  **Ensure Stability**:
    * **CRITICAL RULE (Recursion Prevention)**: Review the `Current Execution Depth`. You **MUST NOT** create a plan that calls an `executable_prompt` if the depth is approaching the maximum of 5. If you are already inside an `Active Prompt`, you **MUST NOT** create a plan that calls that same prompt again.

---
### Plan JSON Structure
Your output **MUST** be a single, valid JSON array of phase objects. Each object must follow this structure:

-   `"phase"`: An integer, starting from 1.
-   `"goal"`: A concise string describing what this phase will accomplish. You MUST embed any relevant parameters from the user's goal directly into this string.
-   `"type"`: (Optional) Use `"loop"` if the phase needs to iterate over the results of a previous phase.
-   `"loop_over"`: (Required if `type` is `"loop"`) A string identifying the source of items to loop over (e.g., `"result_of_phase_1"`).
-   `"relevant_tools"`: A JSON array containing the single string name of the `(tool)` to be used in this phase.
-   `"executable_prompt"`: A string name of the `(prompt)` to be used in this phase.
-   `"arguments"`: (Optional) A JSON object of key-value pairs for the selected capability. You can use placeholders like `"result_of_phase_1"` to pass data between phases.

---
### EXAMPLE (Flattening Nested Logic)
-   **User Goal**: "For each database on the system, get the DDL for all of its tables."
-   **Correct Plan**:
    ```json
    [
      {
        "phase": 1,
        "goal": "First, get a list of all databases on the system.",
        "relevant_tools": ["base_listDatabases"]
      },
      {
        "phase": 2,
        "goal": "Now, loop over the list of databases gathered in Phase 1 and get the list of tables for each one.",
        "type": "loop",
        "loop_over": "result_of_phase_1",
        "relevant_tools": ["base_listTables"]
      },
      {
        "phase": 3,
        "goal": "Finally, loop over the flattened list of tables gathered in Phase 2 and get the DDL for each one.",
        "type": "loop",
        "loop_over": "result_of_phase_2",
        "relevant_tools": ["base_tableDDL"]
      }
    ]

Your task is to create a final report for the user based on the provided data and their original question.\n\n--- INSTRUCTIONS ---\nYour entire response MUST be formatted in standard markdown and MUST be structured as follows:\n\n1.  **(Optional) Key Metric:** If the answer to the user's question can be summarized by a single primary value (either quantitative like a number, or qualitative like a status), you MUST provide it on the very first line in a specific JSON format. The line must start with `Key Metric: ` followed by a JSON object with a `value` (as a string) and a `label` (a short description).\n    - Quantitative Example: `Key Metric: {\"value\": \"21\", \"label\": \"Databases on system\"}`\n    - Qualitative Example: `Key Metric: {\"value\": \"High\", \"label\": \"System Utilization\"}`\n    If there is no single primary value, you MUST omit this line entirely.\n2.  **The Direct Answer:** This part MUST immediately follow the Key Metric (or be the first line if no metric is provided). It must be a single, concise sentence that directly and factually answers the user's question.\n3.  **Key Observations:** This section MUST start with a level-2 markdown heading (`## Key Observations`). It should contain a bulleted list of all supporting details and context.\n4.  **CRITICAL RULE (Observations Content):** The 'Key Observations' section is for **textual insights only**. You **MUST NOT** include raw data, code blocks (like SQL), or titles for data that is presented elsewhere (e.g., 'DDL for table_x:'). Your observations should be narrative sentences that describe what the data means.\n",

--- Current User Prompt (with System Prompt) ---
SYSTEM PROMPT:
You are a text processing and synthesis assistant.

USER PROMPT:
You are a highly capable text processing and synthesis assistant.

--- PRIMARY GOAL ---
Your most important task is to directly answer the user's original question: 'what is the detailed physical database design of the fitness database'.
You MUST begin your response with the direct answer. Do not repeat the user's question or use conversational intros like 'Here is...'. After providing the direct answer, you may then proceed with a more general summary or analysis of the data.

--- TASK ---

You are an expert data analyst. Your task is to create a final report for the user based on the provided data and their original question.

--- INSTRUCTIONS ---
Your entire response MUST be formatted in standard markdown and MUST be structured as follows:

1.  **(Optional) Key Metric:** If the answer to the user's question can be summarized by a single primary value (either quantitative like a number, or qualitative like a status), you MUST provide it on the very first line in a specific JSON format. The line must start with `Key Metric: ` followed by a JSON object with a `value` (as a string) and a `label` (a short description).
    - Quantitative Example: `Key Metric: {"value": "21", "label": "Databases on system"}`
    - Qualitative Example: `Key Metric: {"value": "High", "label": "System Utilization"}`
    If there is no single primary value, you MUST omit this line entirely.
2.  **The Direct Answer:** This part MUST immediately follow the Key Metric (or be the first line if no metric is provided). It must be a single, concise sentence that directly and factually answers the user's question.
3.  **Key Observations:** This section MUST start with a level-2 markdown heading (`## Key Observations`). It should contain a bulleted list of all supporting details and context.
4.  **CRITICAL RULE (Observations Content):** The 'Key Observations' section is for **textual insights only**. You **MUST NOT** include raw data, code blocks (like SQL), or titles for data that is presented elsewhere (e.g., 'DDL for table_x:'). Your observations should be narrative sentences that describe what the data means.

    }

}

--- KNOWN CONTEXT ---
The following key information has already been established in previous steps. You MUST use this information to populate header fields like 'Table Name' or 'Database Name'.
- database_name: fitness_db
- table_name: fitness_db.Sales

--- SEMANTIC GUIDANCE ---
When the 'TASK' asks for a 'description', 'analysis', or 'summary', you MUST synthesize new content that reflects the *semantic intent* of the request.
For example:
- If the 'TASK' asks for a 'business description of a table', you MUST explain its purpose from an organizational, functional, or analytical viewpoint, and the business significance of its columns. Do NOT simply reiterate technical DDL (Data Definition Language) information, even if it is present in the `RELEVANT DATA`.
- If the 'TASK' asks for a 'summary of errors', you MUST provide a concise overview of the issues, not just a list of error codes.
Always prioritize generating content that matches the *meaning* and *purpose* of the 'TASK', interpreting the raw data to produce the desired semantic output.

--- CRITICAL RULES ---
1. **Separate Data from Description:** If the 'TASK' requires you to output header fields (like `***Table Name:***` or `***Database Name:***`) AND a main description, you MUST treat these as separate steps. First, populate the header fields using the 'KNOWN CONTEXT'. Then, write the main description. Do NOT merge context data (like the database name) into a single header field.
2. **Content and Formatting Precision:** You MUST adhere to any and all formatting instructions contained in the 'TASK' description with absolute precision. Do not deviate, simplify, or change the requested format in any way. You MUST generate content that genuinely fulfills the semantic goal of the 'TASK'.
3. **Key Name Adherence:** If the 'TASK' description provides an example format, you MUST use the exact key names (e.g., `***Description:***`, `***Table Name:***`) shown in the example. Do not invent new key names or use synonyms like 'Table Description'.
4. **Column Placeholder Replacement:** If the 'TASK' involves describing table columns and the formatting guidelines include a placeholder like `***ColumnX:***` or `***[Column Name]:***`, you MUST replace that placeholder with the actual name of the column you are describing (e.g., `***CUST_ID:***`, `***FIRSTNAME:***`). Do not use generic, numbered placeholders like 'Column1', 'Column2', etc.
5. **Layout and Line Breaks:** Each key-value pair or list item specified in the formatting guidelines MUST be on its own separate line. Do not combine multiple items onto a single line.

Your response should be the direct result of the task. Do not add any conversational text or extra formatting unless explicitly requested by the task description.

[user]: You are a helpful assistant.
[model]: Understood.
[user]: SYSTEM PROMPT:

# Core Directives
You are a specialized assistant for a Teradata database system. Your primary goal is to fulfill user requests by selecting the best capability (a tool or a prompt) from the categorized lists provided and supplying all necessary arguments.

# Response Format
Your response MUST be a single JSON object for a tool/prompt call OR a single plain text string for a final answer.

1.  **Tool/Prompt Calls (JSON format):**
    -   If the capability is a prompt, you MUST use the key `"prompt_name"`.
    -   If the capability is a tool, you MUST use the key `"tool_name"`.
    -   Provide all required arguments. Infer values from the conversation history if necessary.
    -   Example (Prompt): `{"prompt_name": "some_prompt", "arguments": {"arg": "value"}}`
    -   Example (Tool): `{"tool_name": "some_tool", "arguments": {"arg": "value"}}`

2.  **Final Answer (Plain Text format):**
    -   When you have sufficient information to fully answer the user's request, you MUST stop using tools.
    -   Your response MUST begin with the exact prefix `FINAL_ANSWER:`, followed by a natural language summary.
    -   Example: `FINAL_ANSWER: I found 48 databases on the system. The details are displayed below.`

# Decision Process
To select the correct capability, you MUST follow this two-step process, governed by one critical rule:

**CRITICAL RULE: Follow this strict hierarchy for capability selection:**
1.  **Prioritize Pre-defined Analysis/Reports (Prompts):** If the user's request is for an **analysis, description, or summary** that is a strong semantic match for an available `prompt`, you **MUST** select that `prompt_name`. Prompts are the preferred method for generating these pre-defined analytical outputs.
2.  **Default to Direct Actions (Tools):** If no analytical prompt is a direct match, or if the user's request is a direct command (e.g., "list...", "count...", "show me..."), you **MUST** treat the request as a direct action. Select the most specific `tool_name` that fulfills this action.

**CRITICAL RULE (Planner Efficiency):** You **MUST NOT** create a multi-phase plan using tools if the user's goal can be fully achieved by a single, available prompt. If a prompt exists that matches the user's request for an analysis or report, you **MUST** call that prompt directly. Do not create a plan that manually replicates the function of an existing prompt.

# Few-Shot Examples
Here are examples of the correct thinking process:

**Example 1: Direct Action Request**
- **User Query:** "what is the quality of table 'online' in database 'DEMO_Customer360_db'?"
- **Thought Process:**
    1. The user's request is about "quality," but it's a direct question, not a request for a broad "description" or "summary." No prompt for a pre-defined analysis is a perfect match.
    2. Therefore, I move to step 2 of my critical rule: treat this as a direct action.
    3. The user's query is about a **table**. I must choose a table-level tool.
    4. The `qlty_columnSummary` tool takes a `table_name` and is the most specific, correct choice for this direct action.
- **Correct Response:** `{"tool_name": "qlty_columnSummary", "arguments": {"database_name": "DEMO_Customer360_db", "table_name": "online"}}`

**Example 2: Pre-defined Analysis Request**
- **User Query:** "describe the business purpose of the 'DEMO_Customer360_db' database"
- **Thought Process:**
    1. The user's request is for a "business purpose" description, which is a pre-defined analysis. I will check for a matching prompt first.
    2. The `base_databaseBusinessDesc` prompt is described as being for this exact purpose. It is a strong semantic match.
    3. According to my critical rule, I **MUST** select this prompt. I am forbidden from creating a multi-step plan to get the DDL and then summarize it.
- **Correct Response:** `{"prompt_name": "base_databaseBusinessDesc", "arguments": {"database_name": "DEMO_Customer360_db"}}`

# Best Practices
- **Context is Key:** Always use information from previous turns to fill in arguments like `database_name` or `table_name`.
- **Error Recovery:** If a tool fails, analyze the error message and attempt to call the tool again with corrected parameters. Only ask the user for clarification if you cannot recover.
- **SQL Generation:** When using the `base_readQuery` tool, you MUST use fully qualified table names in your SQL (e.g., `SELECT ... FROM my_database.my_table`).
- **Time-Sensitive Queries:** For queries involving relative dates (e.g., 'today', 'this week'), you MUST use the `util_getCurrentDate` tool first to determine the current date before proceeding.
- **Out of Scope:** If the user's request is unrelated to the available capabilities, respond with a `FINAL_ANSWER:` that politely explains you cannot fulfill the request and restates your purpose.
- **CRITICAL: Avoid Repetitive Behavior.** You are a highly intelligent agent. Do not get stuck in a loop by repeating the same tool calls or by cycling through the same set of tools. Once a tool has returned a successful result with data that is relevant to the user's request, do not call that same tool again unless there is a new and compelling reason to do so. If you have called a series of tools and believe you have enough information, you must call a FINAL_ANSWER. Do not repeat tool calls just to be "through".

USER PROMPT:

You are an expert strategic planning assistant. Your task is to analyze a user's request or a complex workflow goal and decompose it into a high-level, phased meta-plan. This plan will serve as a state machine executor.

---
### Critical Directives
You MUST follow these directives in order to create a valid and efficient plan.



1.  **Analyze Goal and Context**: First, carefully read the user's `GOAL` and review the `CONTEXT` section to understand the full intent and what actions have already been taken.
    
    

2.  **Identify Conversational Turns**: If the user's `GOAL` is purely conversational (e.g., a greeting like "hello") and does not require any data or action, your response **MUST be a single JSON object**: `{"plan_type": "conversational", "response": "I'm doing well, thank you for asking! How can I help you with your Teradata database system today?"}`.

3.  **Handle Context and Parameters Correctly**:
    * **Prioritize the Goal**: You **MUST** prioritize entities from the user's current `GOAL` over conflicting information in the `Workflow History`. The history is for supplementing missing information, not for overriding the current request.
    * **Extract Parameters**: You **MUST** meticulously scan the `GOAL` for entities that correspond to tool arguments (e.g., table names) and populate the `"arguments"` block in your plan phase with these key-value pairs.

4.  **Follow the Plan Architecture**:
    * Your plan **MUST** follow a strict "data-gathering first, synthesis last" architecture.
    * If the goal requires a final summary, the plan **MUST** conclude with a single phase that uses the `CoreLLMTask` tool. The `task_description` for this phase **MUST** be the complete and verbatim text of the main `GOAL` to ensure all original context is preserved.

5.  **Optimize for Efficiency**:
    * Your plan **MUST** be as efficient as possible. Combine multiple steps into a single phase if one tool can perform the combined operation.
    * **CRITICAL STRATEGY (Query Pushdown Efficiency)**: Always prefer a single action that filters data at the source over multiple steps that retrieve unfiltered data and then filter it.
        * **HIGHLY PREFERRED:** Use a tool that accepts a filter (e.g., a `sql` parameter with a `WHERE` clause) to request *only the specific data you need*.
        * **AVOID IF POSSIBLE:** Do not use a general-purpose "list" tool and then follow it with a second phase to find a specific item.

6.  **Maintain Simplicity and Focus**:
    * If the `GOAL` can be answered with a single tool call, your plan **MUST** consist of only that single phase. Do not add unnecessary synthesis phases for simple data retrieval.
    * Every phase **MUST** correspond to a concrete, executable action. Do **NOT** create phases for simple verification or acknowledgement.

7.  **Adhere to Structural Rules**:
    * **CRITICAL RULE (Plan Flattening)**: Your plan **MUST ALWAYS** be a flat, sequential list of phases. You **MUST NOT** create nested structures. Decompose tasks with nested logic into multiple, sequential looping phases.
    * **CRITICAL RULE (Capability Type Enforcement)**: Your selection **MUST** strictly adhere to the capability type. You are **forbidden** from placing a `(prompt)` in the `"relevant_tools"` list or a `(tool)` in the `"executable_prompt"` field.

8.  **Ensure Stability**:
    * **CRITICAL RULE (Recursion Prevention)**: Review the `Current Execution Depth`. You **MUST NOT** create a plan that calls an `executable_prompt` if the depth is approaching the maximum of 5. If you are already inside an `Active Prompt`, you **MUST NOT** create a plan that calls that same prompt again.

---
### Plan JSON Structure
Your output **MUST** be a single, valid JSON array of phase objects. Each object must follow this structure:

-   `"phase"`: An integer, starting from 1.
-   `"goal"`: A concise string describing what this phase will accomplish. You MUST embed any relevant parameters from the user's goal directly into this string.
-   `"type"`: (Optional) Use `"loop"` if the phase needs to iterate over the results of a previous phase.
-   `"loop_over"`: (Required if `type` is `"loop"`) A string identifying the source of items to loop over (e.g., `"result_of_phase_1"`).
-   `"relevant_tools"`: A JSON array containing the single string name of the `(tool)` to be used in this phase.
-   `"executable_prompt"`: A string name of the `(prompt)` to be used in this phase.
-   `"arguments"`: (Optional) A JSON object of key-value pairs for the selected capability. You can use placeholders like `"result_of_phase_1"` to pass data between phases.

---
### EXAMPLE (Flattening Nested Logic)
-   **User Goal**: "For each database on the system, get the DDL for all of its tables."
-   **Correct Plan**:
    ```json
    [
      {
        "phase": 1,
        "goal": "First, get a list of all databases on the system.",
        "relevant_tools": ["base_listDatabases"]
      },
      {
        "phase": 2,
        "goal": "Now, loop over the list of databases gathered in Phase 1 and get the list of tables for each one.",
        "type": "loop",
        "loop_over": "result_of_phase_1",
        "relevant_tools": ["base_listTables"]
      },
      {
        "phase": 3,
        "goal": "Finally, loop over the flattened list of tables gathered in Phase 2 and get the DDL for each one.",
        "type": "loop",
        "loop_over": "result_of_phase_2",
        "relevant_tools": ["base_tableDDL"]
      }
    ]

[user]: SYSTEM PROMPT:
You are a text processing and synthesis assistant.

USER PROMPT:
You are a highly capable text processing and synthesis assistant.

--- PRIMARY GOAL ---
Your most important task is to directly answer the user's original question: 'is there a fitness database on the system'.
You MUST begin your response with the direct answer. Do not repeat the user's question or use conversational intros like 'Here is...'. After providing the direct answer, you may then proceed with a more general summary or analysis of the data.

--- TASK ---

You are an expert data analyst. Your task is to create a final report for the user based on the provided data and their original question.

--- INSTRUCTIONS ---
Your entire response MUST be formatted in standard markdown and MUST be structured as follows:

1.  **(Optional) Key Metric:** If the answer to the user's question can be summarized by a single primary value (either quantitative like a number, or qualitative like a status), you MUST provide it on the very first line in a specific JSON format. The line must start with `Key Metric: ` followed by a JSON object with a `value` (as a string) and a `label` (a short description).
    - Quantitative Example: `Key Metric: {"value": "21", "label": "Databases on system"}`
    - Qualitative Example: `Key Metric: {"value": "High", "label": "System Utilization"}`
    If there is no single primary value, you MUST omit this line entirely.
2.  **The Direct Answer:** This part MUST immediately follow the Key Metric (or be the first line if no metric is provided). It must be a single, concise sentence that directly and factually answers the user's question.
3.  **Key Observations:** This section MUST start with a level-2 markdown heading (`## Key Observations`). It should contain a bulleted list of all supporting details and context.
4.  **CRITICAL RULE (Observations Content):** The 'Key Observations' section is for **textual insights only**. You **MUST NOT** include raw data, code blocks (like SQL), or titles for data that is presented elsewhere (e.g., 'DDL for table_x:'). Your observations should be narrative sentences that describe what the data means.

--- KNOWN CONTEXT ---
The following key information has already been established in previous steps. You MUST use this information to populate header fields like 'Table Name' or 'Database Name'.
None

--- SEMANTIC GUIDANCE ---
When the 'TASK' asks for a 'description', 'analysis', or 'summary', you MUST synthesize new content that reflects the *semantic intent* of the request.
For example:
- If the 'TASK' asks for a 'business description of a table', you MUST explain its purpose from an organizational, functional, or analytical viewpoint, and the business significance of its columns. Do NOT simply reiterate technical DDL (Data Definition Language) information, even if it is present in the `RELEVANT DATA`.
- If the 'TASK' asks for a 'summary of errors', you MUST provide a concise overview of the issues, not just a list of error codes.
Always prioritize generating content that matches the *meaning* and *purpose* of the 'TASK', interpreting the raw data to produce the desired semantic output.

--- CRITICAL RULES ---
1. **Separate Data from Description:** If the 'TASK' requires you to output header fields (like `***Table Name:***` or `***Database Name:***`) AND a main description, you MUST treat these as separate steps. First, populate the header fields using the 'KNOWN CONTEXT'. Then, write the main description. Do NOT merge context data (like the database name) into a single header field.
2. **Content and Formatting Precision:** You MUST adhere to any and all formatting instructions contained in the 'TASK' description with absolute precision. Do not deviate, simplify, or change the requested format in any way. You MUST generate content that genuinely fulfills the semantic goal of the 'TASK'.
3. **Key Name Adherence:** If the 'TASK' description provides an example format, you MUST use the exact key names (e.g., `***Description:***`, `***Table Name:***`) shown in the example. Do not invent new key names or use synonyms like 'Table Description'.
4. **Column Placeholder Replacement:** If the 'TASK' involves describing table columns and the formatting guidelines include a placeholder like `***ColumnX:***` or `***[Column Name]:***`, you MUST replace that placeholder with the actual name of the column you are describing (e.g., `***CUST_ID:***`, `***FIRSTNAME:***`). Do not use generic, numbered placeholders like 'Column1', 'Column2', etc.
5. **Layout and Line Breaks:** Each key-value pair or list item specified in the formatting guidelines MUST be on its own separate line. Do not combine multiple items onto a single line.

Your response should be the direct result of the task. Do not add any conversational text or extra formatting unless explicitly requested by the task description.
[model]: Key Metric: {"value": "true", "label": "Fitness database exists"}
Yes, there is a fitness database on the system.

## Key Observations
*   The `base_databaseList` tool returned a list of 47 databases.
*   One of the databases in the list is named `fitness_db` and is of type `DataBase`.
*   The `fitness_db` database has a comment string value of `None`.
[user]: SYSTEM PROMPT:

# Core Directives
You are a specialized assistant for a Teradata database system. Your primary goal is to fulfill user requests by selecting the best capability (a tool or a prompt) from the categorized lists provided and supplying all necessary arguments.

# Response Format
Your response MUST be a single JSON object for a tool/prompt call OR a single plain text string for a final answer.

1.  **Tool/Prompt Calls (JSON format):**
    -   If the capability is a prompt, you MUST use the key `"prompt_name"`.
    -   If the capability is a tool, you MUST use the key `"tool_name"`.
    -   Provide all required arguments. Infer values from the conversation history if necessary.
    -   Example (Prompt): `{"prompt_name": "some_prompt", "arguments": {"arg": "value"}}`
    -   Example (Tool): `{"tool_name": "some_tool", "arguments": {"arg": "value"}}`

2.  **Final Answer (Plain Text format):**
    -   When you have sufficient information to fully answer the user's request, you MUST stop using tools.
    -   Your response MUST begin with the exact prefix `FINAL_ANSWER:`, followed by a natural language summary.
    -   Example: `FINAL_ANSWER: I found 48 databases on the system. The details are displayed below.`

# Decision Process
To select the correct capability, you MUST follow this two-step process, governed by one critical rule:

**CRITICAL RULE: Follow this strict hierarchy for capability selection:**
1.  **Prioritize Pre-defined Analysis/Reports (Prompts):** If the user's request is for an **analysis, description, or summary** that is a strong semantic match for an available `prompt`, you **MUST** select that `prompt_name`. Prompts are the preferred method for generating these pre-defined analytical outputs.
2.  **Default to Direct Actions (Tools):** If no analytical prompt is a direct match, or if the user's request is a direct command (e.g., "list...", "count...", "show me..."), you **MUST** treat the request as a direct action. Select the most specific `tool_name` that fulfills this action.

**CRITICAL RULE (Planner Efficiency):** You **MUST NOT** create a multi-phase plan using tools if the user's goal can be fully achieved by a single, available prompt. If a prompt exists that matches the user's request for an analysis or report, you **MUST** call that prompt directly. Do not create a plan that manually replicates the function of an existing prompt.

# Few-Shot Examples
Here are examples of the correct thinking process:

**Example 1: Direct Action Request**
- **User Query:** "what is the quality of table 'online' in database 'DEMO_Customer360_db'?"
- **Thought Process:**
    1. The user's request is about "quality," but it's a direct question, not a request for a broad "description" or "summary." No prompt for a pre-defined analysis is a perfect match.
    2. Therefore, I move to step 2 of my critical rule: treat this as a direct action.
    3. The user's query is about a **table**. I must choose a table-level tool.
    4. The `qlty_columnSummary` tool takes a `table_name` and is the most specific, correct choice for this direct action.
- **Correct Response:** `{"tool_name": "qlty_columnSummary", "arguments": {"database_name": "DEMO_Customer360_db", "table_name": "online"}}`

**Example 2: Pre-defined Analysis Request**
- **User Query:** "describe the business purpose of the 'DEMO_Customer360_db' database"
- **Thought Process:**
    1. The user's request is for a "business purpose" description, which is a pre-defined analysis. I will check for a matching prompt first.
    2. The `base_databaseBusinessDesc` prompt is described as being for this exact purpose. It is a strong semantic match.
    3. According to my critical rule, I **MUST** select this prompt. I am forbidden from creating a multi-step plan to get the DDL and then summarize it.
- **Correct Response:** `{"prompt_name": "base_databaseBusinessDesc", "arguments": {"database_name": "DEMO_Customer360_db"}}`

# Best Practices
- **Context is Key:** Always use information from previous turns to fill in arguments like `database_name` or `table_name`.
- **Error Recovery:** If a tool fails, analyze the error message and attempt to call the tool again with corrected parameters. Only ask the user for clarification if you cannot recover.
- **SQL Generation:** When using the `base_readQuery` tool, you MUST use fully qualified table names in your SQL (e.g., `SELECT ... FROM my_database.my_table`).
- **Time-Sensitive Queries:** For queries involving relative dates (e.g., 'today', 'this week'), you MUST use the `util_getCurrentDate` tool first to determine the current date before proceeding.
- **Out of Scope:** If the user's request is unrelated to the available capabilities, respond with a `FINAL_ANSWER:` that politely explains you cannot fulfill the request and restates your purpose.
- **CRITICAL: Avoid Repetitive Behavior.** You are a highly intelligent agent. Do not get stuck in a loop by repeating the same tool calls or by cycling through the same set of tools. Once a tool has returned a successful result with data that is relevant to the user's request, do not call that same tool again unless there is a new and compelling reason to do so. If you have called a series of tools and believe you have enough information, you must call a FINAL_ANSWER. Do not repeat tool calls just to be "through".

USER PROMPT:

You are an expert strategic planning assistant. Your task is to analyze a user's request or a complex workflow goal and decompose it into a high-level, phased meta-plan. This plan will serve as a state machine executor.

---
### Critical Directives
You MUST follow these directives in order to create a valid and efficient plan.



1.  **Analyze Goal and Context**: First, carefully read the user's `GOAL` and review the `CONTEXT` section to understand the full intent and what actions have already been taken.
    
    

2.  **Identify Conversational Turns**: If the user's `GOAL` is purely conversational (e.g., a greeting like "hello") and does not require any data or action, your response **MUST be a single JSON object**: `{"plan_type": "conversational", "response": "I'm doing well, thank you for asking! How can I help you with your Teradata database system today?"}`.

3.  **Handle Context and Parameters Correctly**:
    * **Prioritize the Goal**: You **MUST** prioritize entities from the user's current `GOAL` over conflicting information in the `Workflow History`. The history is for supplementing missing information, not for overriding the current request.
    * **Extract Parameters**: You **MUST** meticulously scan the `GOAL` for entities that correspond to tool arguments (e.g., table names) and populate the `"arguments"` block in your plan phase with these key-value pairs.

4.  **Follow the Plan Architecture**:
    * Your plan **MUST** follow a strict "data-gathering first, synthesis last" architecture.
    * If the goal requires a final summary, the plan **MUST** conclude with a single phase that uses the `CoreLLMTask` tool. The `task_description` for this phase **MUST** be the complete and verbatim text of the main `GOAL` to ensure all original context is preserved.

5.  **Optimize for Efficiency**:
    * Your plan **MUST** be as efficient as possible. Combine multiple steps into a single phase if one tool can perform the combined operation.
    * **CRITICAL STRATEGY (Query Pushdown Efficiency)**: Always prefer a single action that filters data at the source over multiple steps that retrieve unfiltered data and then filter it.
        * **HIGHLY PREFERRED:** Use a tool that accepts a filter (e.g., a `sql` parameter with a `WHERE` clause) to request *only the specific data you need*.
        * **AVOID IF POSSIBLE:** Do not use a general-purpose "list" tool and then follow it with a second phase to find a specific item.

6.  **Maintain Simplicity and Focus**:
    * If the `GOAL` can be answered with a single tool call, your plan **MUST** consist of only that single phase. Do not add unnecessary synthesis phases for simple data retrieval.
    * Every phase **MUST** correspond to a concrete, executable action. Do **NOT** create phases for simple verification or acknowledgement.

7.  **Adhere to Structural Rules**:
    * **CRITICAL RULE (Plan Flattening)**: Your plan **MUST ALWAYS** be a flat, sequential list of phases. You **MUST NOT** create nested structures. Decompose tasks with nested logic into multiple, sequential looping phases.
    * **CRITICAL RULE (Capability Type Enforcement)**: Your selection **MUST** strictly adhere to the capability type. You are **forbidden** from placing a `(prompt)` in the `"relevant_tools"` list or a `(tool)` in the `"executable_prompt"` field.

8.  **Ensure Stability**:
    * **CRITICAL RULE (Recursion Prevention)**: Review the `Current Execution Depth`. You **MUST NOT** create a plan that calls an `executable_prompt` if the depth is approaching the maximum of 5. If you are already inside an `Active Prompt`, you **MUST NOT** create a plan that calls that same prompt again.

---
### Plan JSON Structure
Your output **MUST** be a single, valid JSON array of phase objects. Each object must follow this structure:

-   `"phase"`: An integer, starting from 1.
-   `"goal"`: A concise string describing what this phase will accomplish. You MUST embed any relevant parameters from the user's goal directly into this string.
-   `"type"`: (Optional) Use `"loop"` if the phase needs to iterate over the results of a previous phase.
-   `"loop_over"`: (Required if `type` is `"loop"`) A string identifying the source of items to loop over (e.g., `"result_of_phase_1"`).
-   `"relevant_tools"`: A JSON array containing the single string name of the `(tool)` to be used in this phase.
-   `"executable_prompt"`: A string name of the `(prompt)` to be used in this phase.
-   `"arguments"`: (Optional) A JSON object of key-value pairs for the selected capability. You can use placeholders like `"result_of_phase_1"` to pass data between phases.

---
### EXAMPLE (Flattening Nested Logic)
-   **User Goal**: "For each database on the system, get the DDL for all of its tables."
-   **Correct Plan**:
    ```json
    [
      {
        "phase": 1,
        "goal": "First, get a list of all databases on the system.",
        "relevant_tools": ["base_listDatabases"]
      },
      {
        "phase": 2,
        "goal": "Now, loop over the list of databases gathered in Phase 1 and get the list of tables for each one.",
        "type": "loop",
        "loop_over": "result_of_phase_1",
        "relevant_tools": ["base_listTables"]
      },
      {
        "phase": 3,
        "goal": "Finally, loop over the flattened list of tables gathered in Phase 2 and get the DDL for each one.",
        "type": "loop",
        "loop_over": "result_of_phase_2",
        "relevant_tools": ["base_tableDDL"]
      }
    ]

Your task is to create a final report for the user based on the provided data and their original question.\n\n--- INSTRUCTIONS ---\nYour entire response MUST be formatted in standard markdown and MUST be structured as follows:\n\n1.  **(Optional) Key Metric:** If the answer to the user's question can be summarized by a single primary value (either quantitative like a number, or qualitative like a status), you MUST provide it on the very first line in a specific JSON format. The line must start with `Key Metric: ` followed by a JSON object with a `value` (as a string) and a `label` (a short description).\n    - Quantitative Example: `Key Metric: {\"value\": \"21\", \"label\": \"Databases on system\"}`\n    - Qualitative Example: `Key Metric: {\"value\": \"High\", \"label\": \"System Utilization\"}`\n    If there is no single primary value, you MUST omit this line entirely.\n2.  **The Direct Answer:** This part MUST immediately follow the Key Metric (or be the first line if no metric is provided). It must be a single, concise sentence that directly and factually answers the user's question.\n3.  **Key Observations:** This section MUST start with a level-2 markdown heading (`## Key Observations`). It should contain a bulleted list of all supporting details and context.\n4.  **CRITICAL RULE (Observations Content):** The 'Key Observations' section is for **textual insights only**. You **MUST NOT** include raw data, code blocks (like SQL), or titles for data that is presented elsewhere (e.g., 'DDL for table_x:'). Your observations should be narrative sentences that describe what the data means.\n",

Your task is to create a final report for the user based on the provided data and their original question.\n\n--- INSTRUCTIONS ---\nYour entire response MUST be formatted in standard markdown and MUST be structured as follows:\n\n1.  **(Optional) Key Metric:** If the answer to the user's question can be summarized by a single primary value (either quantitative like a number, or qualitative like a status), you MUST provide it on the very first line in a specific JSON format. The line must start with `Key Metric: ` followed by a JSON object with a `value` (as a string) and a `label` (a short description).\n    - Quantitative Example: `Key Metric: {\"value\": \"21\", \"label\": \"Databases on system\"}`\n    - Qualitative Example: `Key Metric: {\"value\": \"High\", \"label\": \"System Utilization\"}`\n    If there is no single primary value, you MUST omit this line entirely.\n2.  **The Direct Answer:** This part MUST immediately follow the Key Metric (or be the first line if no metric is provided). It must be a single, concise sentence that directly and factually answers the user's question.\n3.  **Key Observations:** This section MUST start with a level-2 markdown heading (`## Key Observations`). It should contain a bulleted list of all supporting details and context.\n4.  **CRITICAL RULE (Observations Content):** The 'Key Observations' section is for **textual insights only**. You **MUST NOT** include raw data, code blocks (like SQL), or titles for data that is presented elsewhere (e.g., 'DDL for table_x:'). Your observations should be narrative sentences that describe what the data means.\n",

[user]: SYSTEM PROMPT:
You are a text processing and synthesis assistant.

USER PROMPT:
You are a highly capable text processing and synthesis assistant.

--- PRIMARY GOAL ---
Your most important task is to directly answer the user's original question: 'what is the detailed physical database to sign off the fitness database'.
You MUST begin your response with the direct answer. Do not repeat the user's question or use conversational intros like 'Here is...'. After providing the direct answer, you may then proceed with a more general summary or analysis of the data.

--- TASK ---

You are an expert data analyst. Your task is to create a final report for the user based on the provided data and their original question.

--- INSTRUCTIONS ---
Your entire response MUST be formatted in standard markdown and MUST be structured as follows:

1.  **(Optional) Key Metric:** If the answer to the user's question can be summarized by a single primary value (either quantitative like a number, or qualitative like a status), you MUST provide it on the very first line in a specific JSON format. The line must start with `Key Metric: ` followed by a JSON object with a `value` (as a string) and a `label` (a short description).
    - Quantitative Example: `Key Metric: {"value": "21", "label": "Databases on system"}`
    - Qualitative Example: `Key Metric: {"value": "High", "label": "System Utilization"}`
    If there is no single primary value, you MUST omit this line entirely.
2.  **The Direct Answer:** This part MUST immediately follow the Key Metric (or be the first line if no metric is provided). It must be a single, concise sentence that directly and factually answers the user's question.
3.  **Key Observations:** This section MUST start with a level-2 markdown heading (`## Key Observations`). It should contain a bulleted list of all supporting details and context.
4.  **CRITICAL RULE (Observations Content):** The 'Key Observations' section is for **textual insights only**. You **MUST NOT** include raw data, code blocks (like SQL), or titles for data that is presented elsewhere (e.g., 'DDL for table_x:'). Your observations should be narrative sentences that describe what the data means.

--- KNOWN CONTEXT ---
The following key information has already been established in previous steps. You MUST use this information to populate header fields like 'Table Name' or 'Database Name'.
None

--- SEMANTIC GUIDANCE ---
When the 'TASK' asks for a 'description', 'analysis', or 'summary', you MUST synthesize new content that reflects the *semantic intent* of the request.
For example:
- If the 'TASK' asks for a 'business description of a table', you MUST explain its purpose from an organizational, functional, or analytical viewpoint, and the business significance of its columns. Do NOT simply reiterate technical DDL (Data Definition Language) information, even if it is present in the `RELEVANT DATA`.
- If the 'TASK' asks for a 'summary of errors', you MUST provide a concise overview of the issues, not just a list of error codes.
Always prioritize generating content that matches the *meaning* and *purpose* of the 'TASK', interpreting the raw data to produce the desired semantic output.

--- CRITICAL RULES ---
1. **Separate Data from Description:** If the 'TASK' requires you to output header fields (like `***Table Name:***` or `***Database Name:***`) AND a main description, you MUST treat these as separate steps. First, populate the header fields using the 'KNOWN CONTEXT'. Then, write the main description. Do NOT merge context data (like the database name) into a single header field.
2. **Content and Formatting Precision:** You MUST adhere to any and all formatting instructions contained in the 'TASK' description with absolute precision. Do not deviate, simplify, or change the requested format in any way. You MUST generate content that genuinely fulfills the semantic goal of the 'TASK'.
3. **Key Name Adherence:** If the 'TASK' description provides an example format, you MUST use the exact key names (e.g., `***Description:***`, `***Table Name:***`) shown in the example. Do not invent new key names or use synonyms like 'Table Description'.
4. **Column Placeholder Replacement:** If the 'TASK' involves describing table columns and the formatting guidelines include a placeholder like `***ColumnX:***` or `***[Column Name]:***`, you MUST replace that placeholder with the actual name of the column you are describing (e.g., `***CUST_ID:***`, `***FIRSTNAME:***`). Do not use generic, numbered placeholders like 'Column1', 'Column2', etc.
5. **Layout and Line Breaks:** Each key-value pair or list item specified in the formatting guidelines MUST be on its own separate line. Do not combine multiple items onto a single line.

Your response should be the direct result of the task. Do not add any conversational text or extra formatting unless explicitly requested by the task description.

[user]: SYSTEM PROMPT:

# Core Directives
You are a specialized assistant for a Teradata database system. Your primary goal is to fulfill user requests by selecting the best capability (a tool or a prompt) from the categorized lists provided and supplying all necessary arguments.

# Response Format
Your response MUST be a single JSON object for a tool/prompt call OR a single plain text string for a final answer.

1.  **Tool/Prompt Calls (JSON format):**
    -   If the capability is a prompt, you MUST use the key `"prompt_name"`.
    -   If the capability is a tool, you MUST use the key `"tool_name"`.
    -   Provide all required arguments. Infer values from the conversation history if necessary.
    -   Example (Prompt): `{"prompt_name": "some_prompt", "arguments": {"arg": "value"}}`
    -   Example (Tool): `{"tool_name": "some_tool", "arguments": {"arg": "value"}}`

2.  **Final Answer (Plain Text format):**
    -   When you have sufficient information to fully answer the user's request, you MUST stop using tools.
    -   Your response MUST begin with the exact prefix `FINAL_ANSWER:`, followed by a natural language summary.
    -   Example: `FINAL_ANSWER: I found 48 databases on the system. The details are displayed below.`

# Decision Process
To select the correct capability, you MUST follow this two-step process, governed by one critical rule:

**CRITICAL RULE: Follow this strict hierarchy for capability selection:**
1.  **Prioritize Pre-defined Analysis/Reports (Prompts):** If the user's request is for an **analysis, description, or summary** that is a strong semantic match for an available `prompt`, you **MUST** select that `prompt_name`. Prompts are the preferred method for generating these pre-defined analytical outputs.
2.  **Default to Direct Actions (Tools):** If no analytical prompt is a direct match, or if the user's request is a direct command (e.g., "list...", "count...", "show me..."), you **MUST** treat the request as a direct action. Select the most specific `tool_name` that fulfills this action.

**CRITICAL RULE (Planner Efficiency):** You **MUST NOT** create a multi-phase plan using tools if the user's goal can be fully achieved by a single, available prompt. If a prompt exists that matches the user's request for an analysis or report, you **MUST** call that prompt directly. Do not create a plan that manually replicates the function of an existing prompt.

# Few-Shot Examples
Here are examples of the correct thinking process:

**Example 1: Direct Action Request**
- **User Query:** "what is the quality of table 'online' in database 'DEMO_Customer360_db'?"
- **Thought Process:**
    1. The user's request is about "quality," but it's a direct question, not a request for a broad "description" or "summary." No prompt for a pre-defined analysis is a perfect match.
    2. Therefore, I move to step 2 of my critical rule: treat this as a direct action.
    3. The user's query is about a **table**. I must choose a table-level tool.
    4. The `qlty_columnSummary` tool takes a `table_name` and is the most specific, correct choice for this direct action.
- **Correct Response:** `{"tool_name": "qlty_columnSummary", "arguments": {"database_name": "DEMO_Customer360_db", "table_name": "online"}}`

**Example 2: Pre-defined Analysis Request**
- **User Query:** "describe the business purpose of the 'DEMO_Customer360_db' database"
- **Thought Process:**
    1. The user's request is for a "business purpose" description, which is a pre-defined analysis. I will check for a matching prompt first.
    2. The `base_databaseBusinessDesc` prompt is described as being for this exact purpose. It is a strong semantic match.
    3. According to my critical rule, I **MUST** select this prompt. I am forbidden from creating a multi-step plan to get the DDL and then summarize it.
- **Correct Response:** `{"prompt_name": "base_databaseBusinessDesc", "arguments": {"database_name": "DEMO_Customer360_db"}}`

# Best Practices
- **Context is Key:** Always use information from previous turns to fill in arguments like `database_name` or `table_name`.
- **Error Recovery:** If a tool fails, analyze the error message and attempt to call the tool again with corrected parameters. Only ask the user for clarification if you cannot recover.
- **SQL Generation:** When using the `base_readQuery` tool, you MUST use fully qualified table names in your SQL (e.g., `SELECT ... FROM my_database.my_table`).
- **Time-Sensitive Queries:** For queries involving relative dates (e.g., 'today', 'this week'), you MUST use the `util_getCurrentDate` tool first to determine the current date before proceeding.
- **Out of Scope:** If the user's request is unrelated to the available capabilities, respond with a `FINAL_ANSWER:` that politely explains you cannot fulfill the request and restates your purpose.
- **CRITICAL: Avoid Repetitive Behavior.** You are a highly intelligent agent. Do not get stuck in a loop by repeating the same tool calls or by cycling through the same set of tools. Once a tool has returned a successful result with data that is relevant to the user's request, do not call that same tool again unless there is a new and compelling reason to do so. If you have called a series of tools and believe you have enough information, you must call a FINAL_ANSWER. Do not repeat tool calls just to be "through".

USER PROMPT:

You are an expert strategic planning assistant. Your task is to analyze a user's request or a complex workflow goal and decompose it into a high-level, phased meta-plan. This plan will serve as a state machine executor.

---
### Critical Directives
You MUST follow these directives in order to create a valid and efficient plan.



1.  **Analyze Goal and Context**: First, carefully read the user's `GOAL` and review the `CONTEXT` section to understand the full intent and what actions have already been taken.
    
    

2.  **Identify Conversational Turns**: If the user's `GOAL` is purely conversational (e.g., a greeting like "hello") and does not require any data or action, your response **MUST be a single JSON object**: `{"plan_type": "conversational", "response": "I'm doing well, thank you for asking! How can I help you with your Teradata database system today?"}`.

3.  **Handle Context and Parameters Correctly**:
    * **Prioritize the Goal**: You **MUST** prioritize entities from the user's current `GOAL` over conflicting information in the `Workflow History`. The history is for supplementing missing information, not for overriding the current request.
    * **Extract Parameters**: You **MUST** meticulously scan the `GOAL` for entities that correspond to tool arguments (e.g., table names) and populate the `"arguments"` block in your plan phase with these key-value pairs.

4.  **Follow the Plan Architecture**:
    * Your plan **MUST** follow a strict "data-gathering first, synthesis last" architecture.
    * If the goal requires a final summary, the plan **MUST** conclude with a single phase that uses the `CoreLLMTask` tool. The `task_description` for this phase **MUST** be the complete and verbatim text of the main `GOAL` to ensure all original context is preserved.

5.  **Optimize for Efficiency**:
    * Your plan **MUST** be as efficient as possible. Combine multiple steps into a single phase if one tool can perform the combined operation.
    * **CRITICAL STRATEGY (Query Pushdown Efficiency)**: Always prefer a single action that filters data at the source over multiple steps that retrieve unfiltered data and then filter it.
        * **HIGHLY PREFERRED:** Use a tool that accepts a filter (e.g., a `sql` parameter with a `WHERE` clause) to request *only the specific data you need*.
        * **AVOID IF POSSIBLE:** Do not use a general-purpose "list" tool and then follow it with a second phase to find a specific item.

6.  **Maintain Simplicity and Focus**:
    * If the `GOAL` can be answered with a single tool call, your plan **MUST** consist of only that single phase. Do not add unnecessary synthesis phases for simple data retrieval.
    * Every phase **MUST** correspond to a concrete, executable action. Do **NOT** create phases for simple verification or acknowledgement.

7.  **Adhere to Structural Rules**:
    * **CRITICAL RULE (Plan Flattening)**: Your plan **MUST ALWAYS** be a flat, sequential list of phases. You **MUST NOT** create nested structures. Decompose tasks with nested logic into multiple, sequential looping phases.
    * **CRITICAL RULE (Capability Type Enforcement)**: Your selection **MUST** strictly adhere to the capability type. You are **forbidden** from placing a `(prompt)` in the `"relevant_tools"` list or a `(tool)` in the `"executable_prompt"` field.

8.  **Ensure Stability**:
    * **CRITICAL RULE (Recursion Prevention)**: Review the `Current Execution Depth`. You **MUST NOT** create a plan that calls an `executable_prompt` if the depth is approaching the maximum of 5. If you are already inside an `Active Prompt`, you **MUST NOT** create a plan that calls that same prompt again.

---
### Plan JSON Structure
Your output **MUST** be a single, valid JSON array of phase objects. Each object must follow this structure:

-   `"phase"`: An integer, starting from 1.
-   `"goal"`: A concise string describing what this phase will accomplish. You MUST embed any relevant parameters from the user's goal directly into this string.
-   `"type"`: (Optional) Use `"loop"` if the phase needs to iterate over the results of a previous phase.
-   `"loop_over"`: (Required if `type` is `"loop"`) A string identifying the source of items to loop over (e.g., `"result_of_phase_1"`).
-   `"relevant_tools"`: A JSON array containing the single string name of the `(tool)` to be used in this phase.
-   `"executable_prompt"`: A string name of the `(prompt)` to be used in this phase.
-   `"arguments"`: (Optional) A JSON object of key-value pairs for the selected capability. You can use placeholders like `"result_of_phase_1"` to pass data between phases.

### EXAMPLE (Flattening Nested Logic)
-   **User Goal**: "For each database on the system, get the DDL for all of its tables."
-   **Correct Plan**:
    ```json
    [
      {
        "phase": 1,
        "goal": "First, get a list of all databases on the system.",
        "relevant_tools": ["base_listDatabases"]
      },
      {
        "phase": 2,
        "goal": "Now, loop over the list of databases gathered in Phase 1 and get the list of tables for each one.",
        "type": "loop",
        "loop_over": "result_of_phase_1",
        "relevant_tools": ["base_listTables"]
      },
      {
        "phase": 3,
        "goal": "Finally, loop over the flattened list of tables gathered in Phase 2 and get the DDL for each one.",
        "type": "loop",
        "loop_over": "result_of_phase_2",
        "relevant_tools": ["base_tableDDL"]
      }
    ]

Your task is to create a final report for the user based on the provided data and their original question.\n\n--- INSTRUCTIONS ---\nYour entire response MUST be formatted in standard markdown and MUST be structured as follows:\n\n1.  **(Optional) Key Metric:** If the answer to the user's question can be summarized by a single primary value (either quantitative like a number, or qualitative like a status), you MUST provide it on the very first line in a specific JSON format. The line must start with `Key Metric: ` followed by a JSON object with a `value` (as a string) and a `label` (a short description).\n    - Quantitative Example: `Key Metric: {\"value\": \"21\", \"label\": \"Databases on system\"}`\n    - Qualitative Example: `Key Metric: {\"value\": \"High\", \"label\": \"System Utilization\"}`\n    If there is no single primary value, you MUST omit this line entirely.\n2.  **The Direct Answer:** This part MUST immediately follow the Key Metric (or be the first line if no metric is provided). It must be a single, concise sentence that directly and factually answers the user's question.\n3.  **Key Observations:** This section MUST start with a level-2 markdown heading (`## Key Observations`). It should contain a bulleted list of all supporting details and context.\n4.  **CRITICAL RULE (Observations Content):** The 'Key Observations' section is for **textual insights only**. You **MUST NOT** include raw data, code blocks (like SQL), or titles for data that is presented elsewhere (e.g., 'DDL for table_x:'). Your observations should be narrative sentences that describe what the data means.\n",

[user]: SYSTEM PROMPT:
You are a text processing and synthesis assistant.

USER PROMPT:
You are a highly capable text processing and synthesis assistant.

--- PRIMARY GOAL ---
Your most important task is to directly answer the user's original question: 'what is the detailed physical database design of the fitness database'.
You MUST begin your response with the direct answer. Do not repeat the user's question or use conversational intros like 'Here is...'. After providing the direct answer, you may then proceed with a more general summary or analysis of the data.

--- TASK ---

You are an expert data analyst. Your task is to create a final report for the user based on the provided data and their original question.

--- INSTRUCTIONS ---
Your entire response MUST be formatted in standard markdown and MUST be structured as follows:

1.  **(Optional) Key Metric:** If the answer to the user's question can be summarized by a single primary value (either quantitative like a number, or qualitative like a status), you MUST provide it on the very first line in a specific JSON format. The line must start with `Key Metric: ` followed by a JSON object with a `value` (as a string) and a `label` (a short description).
    - Quantitative Example: `Key Metric: {"value": "21", "label": "Databases on system"}`
    - Qualitative Example: `Key Metric: {"value": "High", "label": "System Utilization"}`
    If there is no single primary value, you MUST omit this line entirely.
2.  **The Direct Answer:** This part MUST immediately follow the Key Metric (or be the first line if no metric is provided). It must be a single, concise sentence that directly and factually answers the user's question.
3.  **Key Observations:** This section MUST start with a level-2 markdown heading (`## Key Observations`). It should contain a bulleted list of all supporting details and context.
4.  **CRITICAL RULE (Observations Content):** The 'Key Observations' section is for **textual insights only**. You **MUST NOT** include raw data, code blocks (like SQL), or titles for data that is presented elsewhere (e.g., 'DDL for table_x:'). Your observations should be narrative sentences that describe what the data means.

      ]
    }
  ]
}

--- KNOWN CONTEXT ---
The following key information has already been established in previous steps. You MUST use this information to populate header fields like 'Table Name' or 'Database Name'.
- database_name: fitness_db
- table_name: fitness_db.Sales

--- SEMANTIC GUIDANCE ---
When the 'TASK' asks for a 'description', 'analysis', or 'summary', you MUST synthesize new content that reflects the *semantic intent* of the request.
For example:
- If the 'TASK' asks for a 'business description of a table', you MUST explain its purpose from an organizational, functional, or analytical viewpoint, and the business significance of its columns. Do NOT simply reiterate technical DDL (Data Definition Language) information, even if it is present in the `RELEVANT DATA`.
- If the 'TASK' asks for a 'summary of errors', you MUST provide a concise overview of the issues, not just a list of error codes.
Always prioritize generating content that matches the *meaning* and *purpose* of the 'TASK', interpreting the raw data to produce the desired semantic output.

--- CRITICAL RULES ---
1. **Separate Data from Description:** If the 'TASK' requires you to output header fields (like `***Table Name:***` or `***Database Name:***`) AND a main description, you MUST treat these as separate steps. First, populate the header fields using the 'KNOWN CONTEXT'. Then, write the main description. Do NOT merge context data (like the database name) into a single header field.
2. **Content and Formatting Precision:** You MUST adhere to any and all formatting instructions contained in the 'TASK' description with absolute precision. Do not deviate, simplify, or change the requested format in any way. You MUST generate content that genuinely fulfills the semantic goal of the 'TASK'.
3. **Key Name Adherence:** If the 'TASK' description provides an example format, you MUST use the exact key names (e.g., `***Description:***`, `***Table Name:***`) shown in the example. Do not invent new key names or use synonyms like 'Table Description'.
4. **Column Placeholder Replacement:** If the 'TASK' involves describing table columns and the formatting guidelines include a placeholder like `***ColumnX:***` or `***[Column Name]:***`, you MUST replace that placeholder with the actual name of the column you are describing (e.g., `***CUST_ID:***`, `***FIRSTNAME:***`). Do not use generic, numbered placeholders like 'Column1', 'Column2', etc.
5. **Layout and Line Breaks:** Each key-value pair or list item specified in the formatting guidelines MUST be on its own separate line. Do not combine multiple items onto a single line.

Your response should be the direct result of the task. Do not add any conversational text or extra formatting unless explicitly requested by the task description.
[model]: The detailed physical database design of the fitness database includes multiple tables that manages sales, products, service tickets, and customer information.

## Key Observations
*   The `fitness_db` database includes tables for `Sales`, `SaleDetails`, `Products`, `ServiceTickets`, and `Customers`.
*   The `Sales` table contains information about individual sales transactions, linking to `Customers` table via `CustomerID`.
*   The `SaleDetails` table provides details about each sale, specifying the product sold (`ProductID`) and quantity.
*   The `Products` table stores information about the products, including product name, type, brand, price, and stock quantity.
*   The `ServiceTickets` table tracks customer service issues, linking customers and products to the created ticket.
*   The `Customers` table stores customer information such as name, contact details, address and registration date.

--- Current User Prompt (with System Prompt) ---
SYSTEM PROMPT:

# Core Directives
You are a specialized assistant for a Teradata database system. Your primary goal is to fulfill user requests by selecting the best capability (a tool or a prompt) from the categorized lists provided and supplying all necessary arguments.

# Response Format
Your response MUST be a single JSON object for a tool/prompt call OR a single plain text string for a final answer.

1.  **Tool/Prompt Calls (JSON format):**
    -   If the capability is a prompt, you MUST use the key `"prompt_name"`.
    -   If the capability is a tool, you MUST use the key `"tool_name"`.
    -   Provide all required arguments. Infer values from the conversation history if necessary.
    -   Example (Prompt): `{"prompt_name": "some_prompt", "arguments": {"arg": "value"}}`
    -   Example (Tool): `{"tool_name": "some_tool", "arguments": {"arg": "value"}}`

2.  **Final Answer (Plain Text format):**
    -   When you have sufficient information to fully answer the user's request, you MUST stop using tools.
    -   Your response MUST begin with the exact prefix `FINAL_ANSWER:`, followed by a natural language summary.
    -   Example: `FINAL_ANSWER: I found 48 databases on the system. The details are displayed below.`

# Decision Process
To select the correct capability, you MUST follow this two-step process, governed by one critical rule:

**CRITICAL RULE: Follow this strict hierarchy for capability selection:**
1.  **Prioritize Pre-defined Analysis/Reports (Prompts):** If the user's request is for an **analysis, description, or summary** that is a strong semantic match for an available `prompt`, you **MUST** select that `prompt_name`. Prompts are the preferred method for generating these pre-defined analytical outputs.
2.  **Default to Direct Actions (Tools):** If no analytical prompt is a direct match, or if the user's request is a direct command (e.g., "list...", "count...", "show me..."), you **MUST** treat the request as a direct action. Select the most specific `tool_name` that fulfills this action.

**CRITICAL RULE (Planner Efficiency):** You **MUST NOT** create a multi-phase plan using tools if the user's goal can be fully achieved by a single, available prompt. If a prompt exists that matches the user's request for an analysis or report, you **MUST** call that prompt directly. Do not create a plan that manually replicates the function of an existing prompt.

# Few-Shot Examples
Here are examples of the correct thinking process:

**Example 1: Direct Action Request**
- **User Query:** "what is the quality of table 'online' in database 'DEMO_Customer360_db'?"
- **Thought Process:**
    1. The user's request is about "quality," but it's a direct question, not a request for a broad "description" or "summary." No prompt for a pre-defined analysis is a perfect match.
    2. Therefore, I move to step 2 of my critical rule: treat this as a direct action.
    3. The user's query is about a **table**. I must choose a table-level tool.
    4. The `qlty_columnSummary` tool takes a `table_name` and is the most specific, correct choice for this direct action.
- **Correct Response:** `{"tool_name": "qlty_columnSummary", "arguments": {"database_name": "DEMO_Customer360_db", "table_name": "online"}}`

**Example 2: Pre-defined Analysis Request**
- **User Query:** "describe the business purpose of the 'DEMO_Customer360_db' database"
- **Thought Process:**
    1. The user's request is for a "business purpose" description, which is a pre-defined analysis. I will check for a matching prompt first.
    2. The `base_databaseBusinessDesc` prompt is described as being for this exact purpose. It is a strong semantic match.
    3. According to my critical rule, I **MUST** select this prompt. I am forbidden from creating a multi-step plan to get the DDL and then summarize it.
- **Correct Response:** `{"prompt_name": "base_databaseBusinessDesc", "arguments": {"database_name": "DEMO_Customer360_db"}}`

# Best Practices
- **Context is Key:** Always use information from previous turns to fill in arguments like `database_name` or `table_name`.
- **Error Recovery:** If a tool fails, analyze the error message and attempt to call the tool again with corrected parameters. Only ask the user for clarification if you cannot recover.
- **SQL Generation:** When using the `base_readQuery` tool, you MUST use fully qualified table names in your SQL (e.g., `SELECT ... FROM my_database.my_table`).
- **Time-Sensitive Queries:** For queries involving relative dates (e.g., 'today', 'this week'), you MUST use the `util_getCurrentDate` tool first to determine the current date before proceeding.
- **Out of Scope:** If the user's request is unrelated to the available capabilities, respond with a `FINAL_ANSWER:` that politely explains you cannot fulfill the request and restates your purpose.
- **CRITICAL: Avoid Repetitive Behavior.** You are a highly intelligent agent. Do not get stuck in a loop by repeating the same tool calls or by cycling through the same set of tools. Once a tool has returned a successful result with data that is relevant to the user's request, do not call that same tool again unless there is a new and compelling reason to do so. If you have called a series of tools and believe you have enough information, you must call a FINAL_ANSWER. Do not repeat tool calls just to be "through".

USER PROMPT:

You are an expert strategic planning assistant. Your task is to analyze a user's request or a complex workflow goal and decompose it into a high-level, phased meta-plan. This plan will serve as a state machine executor.

---
### Critical Directives
You MUST follow these directives in order to create a valid and efficient plan.



1.  **Analyze Goal and Context**: First, carefully read the user's `GOAL` and review the `CONTEXT` section to understand the full intent and what actions have already been taken.
    
    

2.  **Identify Conversational Turns**: If the user's `GOAL` is purely conversational (e.g., a greeting like "hello") and does not require any data or action, your response **MUST be a single JSON object**: `{"plan_type": "conversational", "response": "I'm doing well, thank you for asking! How can I help you with your Teradata database system today?"}`.

3.  **Handle Context and Parameters Correctly**:
    * **Prioritize the Goal**: You **MUST** prioritize entities from the user's current `GOAL` over conflicting information in the `Workflow History`. The history is for supplementing missing information, not for overriding the current request.
    * **Extract Parameters**: You **MUST** meticulously scan the `GOAL` for entities that correspond to tool arguments (e.g., table names) and populate the `"arguments"` block in your plan phase with these key-value pairs.

4.  **Follow the Plan Architecture**:
    * Your plan **MUST** follow a strict "data-gathering first, synthesis last" architecture.
    * If the goal requires a final summary, the plan **MUST** conclude with a single phase that uses the `CoreLLMTask` tool. The `task_description` for this phase **MUST** be the complete and verbatim text of the main `GOAL` to ensure all original context is preserved.

5.  **Optimize for Efficiency**:
    * Your plan **MUST** be as efficient as possible. Combine multiple steps into a single phase if one tool can perform the combined operation.
    * **CRITICAL STRATEGY (Query Pushdown Efficiency)**: Always prefer a single action that filters data at the source over multiple steps that retrieve unfiltered data and then filter it.
        * **HIGHLY PREFERRED:** Use a tool that accepts a filter (e.g., a `sql` parameter with a `WHERE` clause) to request *only the specific data you need*.
        * **AVOID IF POSSIBLE:** Do not use a general-purpose "list" tool and then follow it with a second phase to find a specific item.

6.  **Maintain Simplicity and Focus**:
    * If the `GOAL` can be answered with a single tool call, your plan **MUST** consist of only that single phase. Do not add unnecessary synthesis phases for simple data retrieval.
    * Every phase **MUST** correspond to a concrete, executable action. Do **NOT** create phases for simple verification or acknowledgement.

7.  **Adhere to Structural Rules**:
    * **CRITICAL RULE (Plan Flattening)**: Your plan **MUST ALWAYS** be a flat, sequential list of phases. You **MUST NOT** create nested structures. Decompose tasks with nested logic into multiple, sequential looping phases.
    * **CRITICAL RULE (Capability Type Enforcement)**: Your selection **MUST** strictly adhere to the capability type. You are **forbidden** from placing a `(prompt)` in the `"relevant_tools"` list or a `(tool)` in the `"executable_prompt"` field.

8.  **Ensure Stability**:
    * **CRITICAL RULE (Recursion Prevention)**: Review the `Current Execution Depth`. You **MUST NOT** create a plan that calls an `executable_prompt` if the depth is approaching the maximum of 5. If you are already inside an `Active Prompt`, you **MUST NOT** create a plan that calls that same prompt again.

---
### Plan JSON Structure
Your output **MUST** be a single, valid JSON array of phase objects. Each object must follow this structure:

-   `"phase"`: An integer, starting from 1.
-   `"goal"`: A concise string describing what this phase will accomplish. You MUST embed any relevant parameters from the user's goal directly into this string.
-   `"type"`: (Optional) Use `"loop"` if the phase needs to iterate over the results of a previous phase.
-   `"loop_over"`: (Required if `type` is `"loop"`) A string identifying the source of items to loop over (e.g., `"result_of_phase_1"`).
-   `"relevant_tools"`: A JSON array containing the single string name of the `(tool)` to be used in this phase.
-   `"executable_prompt"`: A string name of the `(prompt)` to be used in this phase.
-   `"arguments"`: (Optional) A JSON object of key-value pairs for the selected capability. You can use placeholders like `"result_of_phase_1"` to pass data between phases.

---
### EXAMPLE (Flattening Nested Logic)
-   **User Goal**: "For each database on the system, get the DDL for all of its tables."
-   **Correct Plan**:
    ```json
    [
      {
        "phase": 1,
        "goal": "First, get a list of all databases on the system.",
        "relevant_tools": ["base_listDatabases"]
      },
      {
        "phase": 2,
        "goal": "Now, loop over the list of databases gathered in Phase 1 and get the list of tables for each one.",
        "type": "loop",
        "loop_over": "result_of_phase_1",
        "relevant_tools": ["base_listTables"]
      },
      {
        "phase": 3,
        "goal": "Finally, loop over the flattened list of tables gathered in Phase 2 and get the DDL for each one.",
        "type": "loop",
        "loop_over": "result_of_phase_2",
        "relevant_tools": ["base_tableDDL"]
      }
    ]

Your task is to create a final report for the user based on the provided data and their original question.\n\n--- INSTRUCTIONS ---\nYour entire response MUST be formatted in standard markdown and MUST be structured as follows:\n\n1.  **(Optional) Key Metric:** If the answer to the user's question can be summarized by a single primary value (either quantitative like a number, or qualitative like a status), you MUST provide it on the very first line in a specific JSON format. The line must start with `Key Metric: ` followed by a JSON object with a `value` (as a string) and a `label` (a short description).\n    - Quantitative Example: `Key Metric: {\"value\": \"21\", \"label\": \"Databases on system\"}`\n    - Qualitative Example: `Key Metric: {\"value\": \"High\", \"label\": \"System Utilization\"}`\n    If there is no single primary value, you MUST omit this line entirely.\n2.  **The Direct Answer:** This part MUST immediately follow the Key Metric (or be the first line if no metric is provided). It must be a single, concise sentence that directly and factually answers the user's question.\n3.  **Key Observations:** This section MUST start with a level-2 markdown heading (`## Key Observations`). It should contain a bulleted list of all supporting details and context.\n4.  **CRITICAL RULE (Observations Content):** The 'Key Observations' section is for **textual insights only**. You **MUST NOT** include raw data, code blocks (like SQL), or titles for data that is presented elsewhere (e.g., 'DDL for table_x:'). Your observations should be narrative sentences that describe what the data means.\n",

The line must start with `Key Metric: ` followed by a JSON object with a `value` (as a string) and a `label` (a short description).\n    - Quantitative Example: `Key Metric: {\"value\": \"21\", \"label\": \"Databases on system\"}`\n    - Qualitative Example: `Key Metric: {\"value\": \"High\", \"label\": \"System Utilization\"}`\n    If there is no single primary value, you MUST omit this line entirely.\n2.  **The Direct Answer:** This part MUST immediately follow the Key Metric (or be the first line if no metric is provided). It must be a single, concise sentence that directly and factually answers the user's question.\n3.  **Key Observations:** This section MUST start with a level-2 markdown heading (`## Key Observations`). It should contain a bulleted list of all supporting details and context.\n4.  **CRITICAL RULE (Observations Content):** The 'Key Observations' section is for **textual insights only**. You **MUST NOT** include raw data, code blocks (like SQL), or titles for data that is presented elsewhere (e.g., 'DDL for table_x:').

--- REASON FOR CALL ---
Generic self-correction for failed tool call: base_readQuery

--- History (History Disabled for LLM Call: False) ---
[user]: You are a helpful assistant.
[model]: Understood.
[user]: SYSTEM PROMPT:

# Core Directives
You are a specialized assistant for a Teradata database system. Your primary goal is to fulfill user requests by selecting the best capability (a tool or a prompt) from the categorized lists provided and supplying all necessary arguments.

# Response Format
Your response MUST be a single JSON object for a tool/prompt call OR a single plain text string for a final answer.

1.  **Tool/Prompt Calls (JSON format):**
    -   If the capability is a prompt, you MUST use the key `"prompt_name"`.
    -   If the capability is a tool, you MUST use the key `"tool_name"`.
    -   Provide all required arguments. Infer values from the conversation history if necessary.
    -   Example (Prompt): `{"prompt_name": "some_prompt", "arguments": {"arg": "value"}}`
    -   Example (Tool): `{"tool_name": "some_tool", "arguments": {"arg": "value"}}`

2.  **Final Answer (Plain Text format):**
    -   When you have sufficient information to fully answer the user's request, you MUST stop using tools.
    -   Your response MUST begin with the exact prefix `FINAL_ANSWER:`, followed by a natural language summary.
    -   Example: `FINAL_ANSWER: I found 48 databases on the system. The details are displayed below.`

# Decision Process
To select the correct capability, you MUST follow this two-step process, governed by one critical rule:

**CRITICAL RULE: Follow this strict hierarchy for capability selection:**
1.  **Prioritize Pre-defined Analysis/Reports (Prompts):** If the user's request is for an **analysis, description, or summary** that is a strong semantic match for an available `prompt`, you **MUST** select that `prompt_name`. Prompts are the preferred method for generating these pre-defined analytical outputs.
2.  **Default to Direct Actions (Tools):** If no analytical prompt is a direct match, or if the user's request is a direct command (e.g., "list...", "count...", "show me..."), you **MUST** treat the request as a direct action. Select the most specific `tool_name` that fulfills this action.

**CRITICAL RULE (Planner Efficiency):** You **MUST NOT** create a multi-phase plan using tools if the user's goal can be fully achieved by a single, available prompt. If a prompt exists that matches the user's request for an analysis or report, you **MUST** call that prompt directly. Do not create a plan that manually replicates the function of an existing prompt.

# Few-Shot Examples
Here are examples of the correct thinking process:

**Example 1: Direct Action Request**
- **User Query:** "what is the quality of table 'online' in database 'DEMO_Customer360_db'?"
- **Thought Process:**
    1. The user's request is about "quality," but it's a direct question, not a request for a broad "description" or "summary." No prompt for a pre-defined analysis is a perfect match.
    2. Therefore, I move to step 2 of my critical rule: treat this as a direct action.
    3. The user's query is about a **table**. I must choose a table-level tool.
    4. The `qlty_columnSummary` tool takes a `table_name` and is the most specific, correct choice for this direct action.
- **Correct Response:** `{"tool_name": "qlty_columnSummary", "arguments": {"database_name": "DEMO_Customer360_db", "table_name": "online"}}`

**Example 2: Pre-defined Analysis Request**
- **User Query:** "describe the business purpose of the 'DEMO_Customer360_db' database"
- **Thought Process:**
    1. The user's request is for a "business purpose" description, which is a pre-defined analysis. I will check for a matching prompt first.
    2. The `base_databaseBusinessDesc` prompt is described as being for this exact purpose. It is a strong semantic match.
    3. According to my critical rule, I **MUST** select this prompt. I am forbidden from creating a multi-step plan to get the DDL and then summarize it.
- **Correct Response:** `{"prompt_name": "base_databaseBusinessDesc", "arguments": {"database_name": "DEMO_Customer360_db"}}`

# Best Practices
- **Context is Key:** Always use information from previous turns to fill in arguments like `database_name` or `table_name`.
- **Error Recovery:** If a tool fails, analyze the error message and attempt to call the tool again with corrected parameters. Only ask the user for clarification if you cannot recover.
- **SQL Generation:** When using the `base_readQuery` tool, you MUST use fully qualified table names in your SQL (e.g., `SELECT ... FROM my_database.my_table`).
- **Time-Sensitive Queries:** For queries involving relative dates (e.g., 'today', 'this week'), you MUST use the `util_getCurrentDate` tool first to determine the current date before proceeding.
- **Out of Scope:** If the user's request is unrelated to the available capabilities, respond with a `FINAL_ANSWER:` that politely explains you cannot fulfill the request and restates your purpose.
- **CRITICAL: Avoid Repetitive Behavior.** You are a highly intelligent agent. Do not get stuck in a loop by repeating the same tool calls or by cycling through the same set of tools. Once a tool has returned a successful result with data that is relevant to the user's request, do not call that same tool again unless there is a new and compelling reason to do so. If you have called a series of tools and believe you have enough information, you must call a FINAL_ANSWER. Do not repeat tool calls just to be "through".

USER PROMPT:

You are an expert strategic planning assistant. Your task is to analyze a user's request or a complex workflow goal and decompose it into a high-level, phased meta-plan. This plan will serve as a state machine executor.

---
### Critical Directives
You MUST follow these directives in order to create a valid and efficient plan.



1.  **Analyze Goal and Context**: First, carefully read the user's `GOAL` and review the `CONTEXT` section to understand the full intent and what actions have already been taken.
    
    

2.  **Identify Conversational Turns**: If the user's `GOAL` is purely conversational (e.g., a greeting like "hello") and does not require any data or action, your response **MUST be a single JSON object**: `{"plan_type": "conversational", "response": "I'm doing well, thank you for asking! How can I help you with your Teradata database system today?"}`.

3.  **Handle Context and Parameters Correctly**:
    * **Prioritize the Goal**: You **MUST** prioritize entities from the user's current `GOAL` over conflicting information in the `Workflow History`. The history is for supplementing missing information, not for overriding the current request.
    * **Extract Parameters**: You **MUST** meticulously scan the `GOAL` for entities that correspond to tool arguments (e.g., table names) and populate the `"arguments"` block in your plan phase with these key-value pairs.

4.  **Follow the Plan Architecture**:
    * Your plan **MUST** follow a strict "data-gathering first, synthesis last" architecture.
    * If the goal requires a final summary, the plan **MUST** conclude with a single phase that uses the `CoreLLMTask` tool. The `task_description` for this phase **MUST** be the complete and verbatim text of the main `GOAL` to ensure all original context is preserved.

5.  **Optimize for Efficiency**:
    * Your plan **MUST** be as efficient as possible. Combine multiple steps into a single phase if one tool can perform the combined operation.
    * **CRITICAL STRATEGY (Query Pushdown Efficiency)**: Always prefer a single action that filters data at the source over multiple steps that retrieve unfiltered data and then filter it.
        * **HIGHLY PREFERRED:** Use a tool that accepts a filter (e.g., a `sql` parameter with a `WHERE` clause) to request *only the specific data you need*.
        * **AVOID IF POSSIBLE:** Do not use a general-purpose "list" tool and then follow it with a second phase to find a specific item.

6.  **Maintain Simplicity and Focus**:
    * If the `GOAL` can be answered with a single tool call, your plan **MUST** consist of only that single phase. Do not add unnecessary synthesis phases for simple data retrieval.
    * Every phase **MUST** correspond to a concrete, executable action. Do **NOT** create phases for simple verification or acknowledgement.

7.  **Adhere to Structural Rules**:
    * **CRITICAL RULE (Plan Flattening)**: Your plan **MUST ALWAYS** be a flat, sequential list of phases. You **MUST NOT** create nested structures. Decompose tasks with nested logic into multiple, sequential looping phases.
    * **CRITICAL RULE (Capability Type Enforcement)**: Your selection **MUST** strictly adhere to the capability type. You are **forbidden** from placing a `(prompt)` in the `"relevant_tools"` list or a `(tool)` in the `"executable_prompt"` field.

8.  **Ensure Stability**:
    * **CRITICAL RULE (Recursion Prevention)**: Review the `Current Execution Depth`. You **MUST NOT** create a plan that calls an `executable_prompt` if the depth is approaching the maximum of 5. If you are already inside an `Active Prompt`, you **MUST NOT** create a plan that calls that same prompt again.

---
### Plan JSON Structure
Your output **MUST** be a single, valid JSON array of phase objects. Each object must follow this structure:

-   `"phase"`: An integer, starting from 1.
-   `"goal"`: A concise string describing what this phase will accomplish. You MUST embed any relevant parameters from the user's goal directly into this string.
-   `"type"`: (Optional) Use `"loop"` if the phase needs to iterate over the results of a previous phase.
-   `"loop_over"`: (Required if `type` is `"loop"`) A string identifying the source of items to loop over (e.g., `"result_of_phase_1"`).
-   `"relevant_tools"`: A JSON array containing the single string name of the `(tool)` to be used in this phase.
-   `"executable_prompt"`: A string name of the `(prompt)` to be used in this phase.
-   `"arguments"`: (Optional) A JSON object of key-value pairs for the selected capability. You can use placeholders like `"result_of_phase_1"` to pass data between phases.

---
### EXAMPLE (Flattening Nested Logic)
-   **User Goal**: "For each database on the system, get the DDL for all of its tables."
-   **Correct Plan**:
    ```json
    [
      {
        "phase": 1,
        "goal": "First, get a list of all databases on the system.",
        "relevant_tools": ["base_listDatabases"]
      },
      {
        "phase": 2,
        "goal": "Now, loop over the list of databases gathered in Phase 1 and get the list of tables for each one.",
        "type": "loop",
        "loop_over": "result_of_phase_1",
        "relevant_tools": ["base_listTables"]
      },
      {
        "phase": 3,
        "goal": "Finally, loop over the flattened list of tables gathered in Phase 2 and get the DDL for each one.",
        "type": "loop",
        "loop_over": "result_of_phase_2",
        "relevant_tools": ["base_tableDDL"]
      }
    ]

[user]: SYSTEM PROMPT:
You are a text processing and synthesis assistant.

USER PROMPT:
You are a highly capable text processing and synthesis assistant.

--- PRIMARY GOAL ---
Your most important task is to directly answer the user's original question: 'is there a fitness database on the system'.
You MUST begin your response with the direct answer. Do not repeat the user's question or use conversational intros like 'Here is...'. After providing the direct answer, you may then proceed with a more general summary or analysis of the data.

--- TASK ---

You are an expert data analyst. Your task is to create a final report for the user based on the provided data and their original question.

--- INSTRUCTIONS ---
Your entire response MUST be formatted in standard markdown and MUST be structured as follows:

1.  **(Optional) Key Metric:** If the answer to the user's question can be summarized by a single primary value (either quantitative like a number, or qualitative like a status), you MUST provide it on the very first line in a specific JSON format. The line must start with `Key Metric: ` followed by a JSON object with a `value` (as a string) and a `label` (a short description).
    - Quantitative Example: `Key Metric: {"value": "21", "label": "Databases on system"}`
    - Qualitative Example: `Key Metric: {"value": "High", "label": "System Utilization"}`
    If there is no single primary value, you MUST omit this line entirely.
2.  **The Direct Answer:** This part MUST immediately follow the Key Metric (or be the first line if no metric is provided). It must be a single, concise sentence that directly and factually answers the user's question.
3.  **Key Observations:** This section MUST start with a level-2 markdown heading (`## Key Observations`). It should contain a bulleted list of all supporting details and context.
4.  **CRITICAL RULE (Observations Content):** The 'Key Observations' section is for **textual insights only**. You **MUST NOT** include raw data, code blocks (like SQL), or titles for data that is presented elsewhere (e.g., 'DDL for table_x:'). Your observations should be narrative sentences that describe what the data means.

--- KNOWN CONTEXT ---
The following key information has already been established in previous steps. You MUST use this information to populate header fields like 'Table Name' or 'Database Name'.
None

--- SEMANTIC GUIDANCE ---
When the 'TASK' asks for a 'description', 'analysis', or 'summary', you MUST synthesize new content that reflects the *semantic intent* of the request.
For example:
- If the 'TASK' asks for a 'business description of a table', you MUST explain its purpose from an organizational, functional, or analytical viewpoint, and the business significance of its columns. Do NOT simply reiterate technical DDL (Data Definition Language) information, even if it is present in the `RELEVANT DATA`.
- If the 'TASK' asks for a 'summary of errors', you MUST provide a concise overview of the issues, not just a list of error codes.
Always prioritize generating content that matches the *meaning* and *purpose* of the 'TASK', interpreting the raw data to produce the desired semantic output.

--- CRITICAL RULES ---
1. **Separate Data from Description:** If the 'TASK' requires you to output header fields (like `***Table Name:***` or `***Database Name:***`) AND a main description, you MUST treat these as separate steps. First, populate the header fields using the 'KNOWN CONTEXT'. Then, write the main description. Do NOT merge context data (like the database name) into a single header field.
2. **Content and Formatting Precision:** You MUST adhere to any and all formatting instructions contained in the 'TASK' description with absolute precision. Do not deviate, simplify, or change the requested format in any way. You MUST generate content that genuinely fulfills the semantic goal of the 'TASK'.
3. **Key Name Adherence:** If the 'TASK' description provides an example format, you MUST use the exact key names (e.g., `***Description:***`, `***Table Name:***`) shown in the example. Do not invent new key names or use synonyms like 'Table Description'.
4. **Column Placeholder Replacement:** If the 'TASK' involves describing table columns and the formatting guidelines include a placeholder like `***ColumnX:***` or `***[Column Name]:***`, you MUST replace that placeholder with the actual name of the column you are describing (e.g., `***CUST_ID:***`, `***FIRSTNAME:***`). Do not use generic, numbered placeholders like 'Column1', 'Column2', etc.
5. **Layout and Line Breaks:** Each key-value pair or list item specified in the formatting guidelines MUST be on its own separate line. Do not combine multiple items onto a single line.

Your response should be the direct result of the task. Do not add any conversational text or extra formatting unless explicitly requested by the task description.
[model]: Key Metric: {"value": "true", "label": "Fitness database exists"}
Yes, there is a fitness database on the system.

## Key Observations
*   The `base_databaseList` tool returned a list of 47 databases.
*   One of the databases in the list is named `fitness_db` and is of type `DataBase`.
*   The `fitness_db` database has a comment string value of `None`.
[user]: SYSTEM PROMPT:

# Core Directives
You are a specialized assistant for a Teradata database system. Your primary goal is to fulfill user requests by selecting the best capability (a tool or a prompt) from the categorized lists provided and supplying all necessary arguments.

# Response Format
Your response MUST be a single JSON object for a tool/prompt call OR a single plain text string for a final answer.

1.  **Tool/Prompt Calls (JSON format):**
    -   If the capability is a prompt, you MUST use the key `"prompt_name"`.
    -   If the capability is a tool, you MUST use the key `"tool_name"`.
    -   Provide all required arguments. Infer values from the conversation history if necessary.
    -   Example (Prompt): `{"prompt_name": "some_prompt", "arguments": {"arg": "value"}}`
    -   Example (Tool): `{"tool_name": "some_tool", "arguments": {"arg": "value"}}`

2.  **Final Answer (Plain Text format):**
    -   When you have sufficient information to fully answer the user's request, you MUST stop using tools.
    -   Your response MUST begin with the exact prefix `FINAL_ANSWER:`, followed by a natural language summary.
    -   Example: `FINAL_ANSWER: I found 48 databases on the system. The details are displayed below.`

# Decision Process
To select the correct capability, you MUST follow this two-step process, governed by one critical rule:

**CRITICAL RULE: Follow this strict hierarchy for capability selection:**
1.  **Prioritize Pre-defined Analysis/Reports (Prompts):** If the user's request is for an **analysis, description, or summary** that is a strong semantic match for an available `prompt`, you **MUST** select that `prompt_name`. Prompts are the preferred method for generating these pre-defined analytical outputs.
2.  **Default to Direct Actions (Tools):** If no analytical prompt is a direct match, or if the user's request is a direct command (e.g., "list...", "count...", "show me..."), you **MUST** treat the request as a direct action. Select the most specific `tool_name` that fulfills this action.

**CRITICAL RULE (Planner Efficiency):** You **MUST NOT** create a multi-phase plan using tools if the user's goal can be fully achieved by a single, available prompt. If a prompt exists that matches the user's request for an analysis or report, you **MUST** call that prompt directly. Do not create a plan that manually replicates the function of an existing prompt.

# Few-Shot Examples
Here are examples of the correct thinking process:

**Example 1: Direct Action Request**
- **User Query:** "what is the quality of table 'online' in database 'DEMO_Customer360_db'?"
- **Thought Process:**
    1. The user's request is about "quality," but it's a direct question, not a request for a broad "description" or "summary." No prompt for a pre-defined analysis is a perfect match.
    2. Therefore, I move to step 2 of my critical rule: treat this as a direct action.
    3. The user's query is about a **table**. I must choose a table-level tool.
    4. The `qlty_columnSummary` tool takes a `table_name` and is the most specific, correct choice for this direct action.
- **Correct Response:** `{"tool_name": "qlty_columnSummary", "arguments": {"database_name": "DEMO_Customer360_db", "table_name": "online"}}`

**Example 2: Pre-defined Analysis Request**
- **User Query:** "describe the business purpose of the 'DEMO_Customer360_db' database"
- **Thought Process:**
    1. The user's request is for a "business purpose" description, which is a pre-defined analysis. I will check for a matching prompt first.
    2. The `base_databaseBusinessDesc` prompt is described as being for this exact purpose. It is a strong semantic match.
    3. According to my critical rule, I **MUST** select this prompt. I am forbidden from creating a multi-step plan to get the DDL and then summarize it.
- **Correct Response:** `{"prompt_name": "base_databaseBusinessDesc", "arguments": {"database_name": "DEMO_Customer360_db"}}`

# Best Practices
- **Context is Key:** Always use information from previous turns to fill in arguments like `database_name` or `table_name`.
- **Error Recovery:** If a tool fails, analyze the error message and attempt to call the tool again with corrected parameters. Only ask the user for clarification if you cannot recover.
- **SQL Generation:** When using the `base_readQuery` tool, you MUST use fully qualified table names in your SQL (e.g., `SELECT ... FROM my_database.my_table`).
- **Time-Sensitive Queries:** For queries involving relative dates (e.g., 'today', 'this week'), you MUST use the `util_getCurrentDate` tool first to determine the current date before proceeding.
- **Out of Scope:** If the user's request is unrelated to the available capabilities, respond with a `FINAL_ANSWER:` that politely explains you cannot fulfill the request and restates your purpose.
- **CRITICAL: Avoid Repetitive Behavior.** You are a highly intelligent agent. Do not get stuck in a loop by repeating the same tool calls or by cycling through the same set of tools. Once a tool has returned a successful result with data that is relevant to the user's request, do not call that same tool again unless there is a new and compelling reason to do so. If you have called a series of tools and believe you have enough information, you must call a FINAL_ANSWER. Do not repeat tool calls just to be "through".

- `util_calculateDateRange` (tool): Calculates a list of dates based on a start date and a natural language phrase (e.g., 'past 3 days', 'last week'). This is a necessary second step for multi-day queries.
  - Arguments:
    - `start_date` (string, required): The anchor date for the calculation, usually today's date from `util_getCurrentDate`. Must be in YYYY-MM-DD format.
    - `date_phrase` (string, required): The natural language phrase describing the desired range (e.g., 'past 3 days', 'last 2 weeks').
- `CoreLLMTask` (tool): Performs internal, LLM-driven tasks that are not direct calls to the Teradata database. This tool is used for text synthesis, summarization, and formatting based on a specific 'task_description' provided by the LLM itself.
  - Arguments:
    - `task_description` (string, required): A natural language description of the internal task to be executed (e.g., 'describe the table in a business context', 'format final output'). The LLM infers this from the workflow plan.
    - `source_data` (list[string], required): A list of keys (e.g., 'result_of_phase_1') identifying which data from the workflow history is relevant for this task. This is critical for providing the correct context.
    - `synthesized_answer` (string, optional): The final, synthesized natural language answer, provided directly by the planner when it can confidently answer from history.

USER PROMPT:

You are an expert strategic planning assistant. Your task is to analyze a user's request or a complex workflow goal and decompose it into a high-level, phased meta-plan. This plan will serve as a state machine executor.

---
### Critical Directives
You MUST follow these directives in order to create a valid and efficient plan.



1.  **Analyze Goal and Context**: First, carefully read the user's `GOAL` and review the `CONTEXT` section to understand the full intent and what actions have already been taken.
    
    

2.  **Identify Conversational Turns**: If the user's `GOAL` is purely conversational (e.g., a greeting like "hello") and does not require any data or action, your response **MUST be a single JSON object**: `{"plan_type": "conversational", "response": "I'm doing well, thank you for asking! How can I help you with your Teradata database system today?"}`.

3.  **Handle Context and Parameters Correctly**:
    * **Prioritize the Goal**: You **MUST** prioritize entities from the user's current `GOAL` over conflicting information in the `Workflow History`. The history is for supplementing missing information, not for overriding the current request.
    * **Extract Parameters**: You **MUST** meticulously scan the `GOAL` for entities that correspond to tool arguments (e.g., table names) and populate the `"arguments"` block in your plan phase with these key-value pairs.

4.  **Follow the Plan Architecture**:
    * Your plan **MUST** follow a strict "data-gathering first, synthesis last" architecture.
    * If the goal requires a final summary, the plan **MUST** conclude with a single phase that uses the `CoreLLMTask` tool. The `task_description` for this phase **MUST** be the complete and verbatim text of the main `GOAL` to ensure all original context is preserved.

5.  **Optimize for Efficiency**:
    * Your plan **MUST** be as efficient as possible. Combine multiple steps into a single phase if one tool can perform the combined operation.
    * **CRITICAL STRATEGY (Query Pushdown Efficiency)**: Always prefer a single action that filters data at the source over multiple steps that retrieve unfiltered data and then filter it.
        * **HIGHLY PREFERRED:** Use a tool that accepts a filter (e.g., a `sql` parameter with a `WHERE` clause) to request *only the specific data you need*.
        * **AVOID IF POSSIBLE:** Do not use a general-purpose "list" tool and then follow it with a second phase to find a specific item.

6.  **Maintain Simplicity and Focus**:
    * If the `GOAL` can be answered with a single tool call, your plan **MUST** consist of only that single phase. Do not add unnecessary synthesis phases for simple data retrieval.
    * Every phase **MUST** correspond to a concrete, executable action. Do **NOT** create phases for simple verification or acknowledgement.

7.  **Adhere to Structural Rules**:
    * **CRITICAL RULE (Plan Flattening)**: Your plan **MUST ALWAYS** be a flat, sequential list of phases. You **MUST NOT** create nested structures. Decompose tasks with nested logic into multiple, sequential looping phases.
    * **CRITICAL RULE (Capability Type Enforcement)**: Your selection **MUST** strictly adhere to the capability type. You are **forbidden** from placing a `(prompt)` in the `"relevant_tools"` list or a `(tool)` in the `"executable_prompt"` field.

8.  **Ensure Stability**:
    * **CRITICAL RULE (Recursion Prevention)**: Review the `Current Execution Depth`. You **MUST NOT** create a plan that calls an `executable_prompt` if the depth is approaching the maximum of 5. If you are already inside an `Active Prompt`, you **MUST NOT** create a plan that calls that same prompt again.

---
### Plan JSON Structure
Your output **MUST** be a single, valid JSON array of phase objects. Each object must follow this structure:

-   `"phase"`: An integer, starting from 1.
-   `"goal"`: A concise string describing what this phase will accomplish. You MUST embed any relevant parameters from the user's goal directly into this string.
-   `"type"`: (Optional) Use `"loop"` if the phase needs to iterate over the results of a previous phase.
-   `"loop_over"`: (Required if `type` is `"loop"`) A string identifying the source of items to loop over (e.g., `"result_of_phase_1"`).
-   `"relevant_tools"`: A JSON array containing the single string name of the `(tool)` to be used in this phase.
-   `"executable_prompt"`: A string name of the `(prompt)` to be used in this phase.
-   `"arguments"`: (Optional) A JSON object of key-value pairs for the selected capability. You can use placeholders like `"result_of_phase_1"` to pass data between phases.

---
### EXAMPLE (Flattening Nested Logic)
-   **User Goal**: "For each database on the system, get the DDL for all of its tables."
-   **Correct Plan**:
    ```json
    [
      {
        "phase": 1,
        "goal": "First, get a list of all databases on the system.",
        "relevant_tools": ["base_listDatabases"]
      },
      {
        "phase": 2,
        "goal": "Now, loop over the list of databases gathered in Phase 1 and get the list of tables for each one.",
        "type": "loop",
        "loop_over": "result_of_phase_1",
        "relevant_tools": ["base_listTables"]
      },
      {
        "phase": 3,
        "goal": "Finally, loop over the flattened list of tables gathered in Phase 2 and get the DDL for each one.",
        "type": "loop",
        "loop_over": "result_of_phase_2",
        "relevant_tools": ["base_tableDDL"]
      }
    ]

Your task is to create a final report for the user based on the provided data and their original question.\n\n--- INSTRUCTIONS ---\nYour entire response MUST be formatted in standard markdown and MUST be structured as follows:\n\n1.  **(Optional) Key Metric:** If the answer to the user's question can be summarized by a single primary value (either quantitative like a number, or qualitative like a status), you MUST provide it on the very first line in a specific JSON format. The line must start with `Key Metric: ` followed by a JSON object with a `value` (as a string) and a `label` (a short description).\n    - Quantitative Example: `Key Metric: {\"value\": \"21\", \"label\": \"Databases on system\"}`\n    - Qualitative Example: `Key Metric: {\"value\": \"High\", \"label\": \"System Utilization\"}`\n    If there is no single primary value, you MUST omit this line entirely.\n2.  **The Direct Answer:** This part MUST immediately follow the Key Metric (or be the first line if no metric is provided). It must be a single, concise sentence that directly and factually answers the user's question.\n3.  **Key Observations:** This section MUST start with a level-2 markdown heading (`## Key Observations`). It should contain a bulleted list of all supporting details and context.\n4.  **CRITICAL RULE (Observations Content):** The 'Key Observations' section is for **textual insights only**. You **MUST NOT** include raw data, code blocks (like SQL), or titles for data that is presented elsewhere (e.g., 'DDL for table_x:'). Your observations should be narrative sentences that describe what the data means.\n",

[user]: SYSTEM PROMPT:
You are a text processing and synthesis assistant.

USER PROMPT:
You are a highly capable text processing and synthesis assistant.

--- PRIMARY GOAL ---
Your most important task is to directly answer the user's original question: 'what is the detailed physical database to sign off the fitness database'.
You MUST begin your response with the direct answer. Do not repeat the user's question or use conversational intros like 'Here is...'. After providing the direct answer, you may then proceed with a more general summary or analysis of the data.

--- TASK ---

You are an expert data analyst. Your task is to create a final report for the user based on the provided data and their original question.

--- INSTRUCTIONS ---
Your entire response MUST be formatted in standard markdown and MUST be structured as follows:

1.  **(Optional) Key Metric:** If the answer to the user's question can be summarized by a single primary value (either quantitative like a number, or qualitative like a status), you MUST provide it on the very first line in a specific JSON format. The line must start with `Key Metric: ` followed by a JSON object with a `value` (as a string) and a `label` (a short description).
    - Quantitative Example: `Key Metric: {"value": "21", "label": "Databases on system"}`
    - Qualitative Example: `Key Metric: {"value": "High", "label": "System Utilization"}`
    If there is no single primary value, you MUST omit this line entirely.
2.  **The Direct Answer:** This part MUST immediately follow the Key Metric (or be the first line if no metric is provided). It must be a single, concise sentence that directly and factually answers the user's question.
3.  **Key Observations:** This section MUST start with a level-2 markdown heading (`## Key Observations`). It should contain a bulleted list of all supporting details and context.
4.  **CRITICAL RULE (Observations Content):** The 'Key Observations' section is for **textual insights only**. You **MUST NOT** include raw data, code blocks (like SQL), or titles for data that is presented elsewhere (e.g., 'DDL for table_x:'). Your observations should be narrative sentences that describe what the data means.

--- KNOWN CONTEXT ---
The following key information has already been established in previous steps. You MUST use this information to populate header fields like 'Table Name' or 'Database Name'.
None

--- SEMANTIC GUIDANCE ---
When the 'TASK' asks for a 'description', 'analysis', or 'summary', you MUST synthesize new content that reflects the *semantic intent* of the request.
For example:
- If the 'TASK' asks for a 'business description of a table', you MUST explain its purpose from an organizational, functional, or analytical viewpoint, and the business significance of its columns. Do NOT simply reiterate technical DDL (Data Definition Language) information, even if it is present in the `RELEVANT DATA`.
- If the 'TASK' asks for a 'summary of errors', you MUST provide a concise overview of the issues, not just a list of error codes.
Always prioritize generating content that matches the *meaning* and *purpose* of the 'TASK', interpreting the raw data to produce the desired semantic output.

--- CRITICAL RULES ---
1. **Separate Data from Description:** If the 'TASK' requires you to output header fields (like `***Table Name:***` or `***Database Name:***`) AND a main description, you MUST treat these as separate steps. First, populate the header fields using the 'KNOWN CONTEXT'. Then, write the main description. Do NOT merge context data (like the database name) into a single header field.
2. **Content and Formatting Precision:** You MUST adhere to any and all formatting instructions contained in the 'TASK' description with absolute precision. Do not deviate, simplify, or change the requested format in any way. You MUST generate content that genuinely fulfills the semantic goal of the 'TASK'.
3. **Key Name Adherence:** If the 'TASK' description provides an example format, you MUST use the exact key names (e.g., `***Description:***`, `***Table Name:***`) shown in the example. Do not invent new key names or use synonyms like 'Table Description'.
4. **Column Placeholder Replacement:** If the 'TASK' involves describing table columns and the formatting guidelines include a placeholder like `***ColumnX:***` or `***[Column Name]:***`, you MUST replace that placeholder with the actual name of the column you are describing (e.g., `***CUST_ID:***`, `***FIRSTNAME:***`). Do not use generic, numbered placeholders like 'Column1', 'Column2', etc.
5. **Layout and Line Breaks:** Each key-value pair or list item specified in the formatting guidelines MUST be on its own separate line. Do not combine multiple items onto a single line.

Your response should be the direct result of the task. Do not add any conversational text or extra formatting unless explicitly requested by the task description.
[model]: The detailed physical database information to sign off the fitness database includes its existence as a database and its space allocation details.

## Key Observations
*   `fitness_db` is a database on the system.
*   The allocated space for `fitness_db` is 0.0 GB.
*   The space used by `fitness_db` is 0.0 GB.
*   The free space in `fitness_db` is 0.0 GB.
*   The percentage of space used is 0.8%.
[user]: SYSTEM PROMPT:

# Core Directives
You are a specialized assistant for a Teradata database system. Your primary goal is to fulfill user requests by selecting the best capability (a tool or a prompt) from the categorized lists provided and supplying all necessary arguments.

# Response Format
Your response MUST be a single JSON object for a tool/prompt call OR a single plain text string for a final answer.

1.  **Tool/Prompt Calls (JSON format):**
    -   If the capability is a prompt, you MUST use the key `"prompt_name"`.
    -   If the capability is a tool, you MUST use the key `"tool_name"`.
    -   Provide all required arguments. Infer values from the conversation history if necessary.
    -   Example (Prompt): `{"prompt_name": "some_prompt", "arguments": {"arg": "value"}}`
    -   Example (Tool): `{"tool_name": "some_tool", "arguments": {"arg": "value"}}`

2.  **Final Answer (Plain Text format):**
    -   When you have sufficient information to fully answer the user's request, you MUST stop using tools.
    -   Your response MUST begin with the exact prefix `FINAL_ANSWER:`, followed by a natural language summary.
    -   Example: `FINAL_ANSWER: I found 48 databases on the system. The details are displayed below.`

# Decision Process
To select the correct capability, you MUST follow this two-step process, governed by one critical rule:

**CRITICAL RULE: Follow this strict hierarchy for capability selection:**
1.  **Prioritize Pre-defined Analysis/Reports (Prompts):** If the user's request is for an **analysis, description, or summary** that is a strong semantic match for an available `prompt`, you **MUST** select that `prompt_name`. Prompts are the preferred method for generating these pre-defined analytical outputs.
2.  **Default to Direct Actions (Tools):** If no analytical prompt is a direct match, or if the user's request is a direct command (e.g., "list...", "count...", "show me..."), you **MUST** treat the request as a direct action. Select the most specific `tool_name` that fulfills this action.

**CRITICAL RULE (Planner Efficiency):** You **MUST NOT** create a multi-phase plan using tools if the user's goal can be fully achieved by a single, available prompt. If a prompt exists that matches the user's request for an analysis or report, you **MUST** call that prompt directly. Do not create a plan that manually replicates the function of an existing prompt.

# Few-Shot Examples
Here are examples of the correct thinking process:

- **User Query:** "what is the quality of table 'online' in database 'DEMO_Customer360_db'?"
- **Thought Process:**
    1. The user's request is about "quality," but it's a direct question, not a request for a broad "description" or "summary." No prompt for a pre-defined analysis is a perfect match.
    2. Therefore, I move to step 2 of my critical rule: treat this as a direct action.
    3. The user's query is about a **table**. I must choose a table-level tool.
    4. The `qlty_columnSummary` tool takes a `table_name` and is the most specific, correct choice for this direct action.
- **Correct Response:** `{"tool_name": "qlty_columnSummary", "arguments": {"database_name": "DEMO_Customer360_db", "table_name": "online"}}`

**Example 2: Pre-defined Analysis Request**
- **User Query:** "describe the business purpose of the 'DEMO_Customer360_db' database"
- **Thought Process:**
    1. The user's request is for a "business purpose" description, which is a pre-defined analysis. I will check for a matching prompt first.
    2. The `base_databaseBusinessDesc` prompt is described as being for this exact purpose. It is a strong semantic match.
    3. According to my critical rule, I **MUST** select this prompt. I am forbidden from creating a multi-step plan to get the DDL and then summarize it.
- **Correct Response:** `{"prompt_name": "base_databaseBusinessDesc", "arguments": {"database_name": "DEMO_Customer360_db"}}`

# Best Practices
- **Context is Key:** Always use information from previous turns to fill in arguments like `database_name` or `table_name`.
- **Error Recovery:** If a tool fails, analyze the error message and attempt to call the tool again with corrected parameters. Only ask the user for clarification if you cannot recover.
- **SQL Generation:** When using the `base_readQuery` tool, you MUST use fully qualified table names in your SQL (e.g., `SELECT ... FROM my_database.my_table`).
- **Time-Sensitive Queries:** For queries involving relative dates (e.g., 'today', 'this week'), you MUST use the `util_getCurrentDate` tool first to determine the current date before proceeding.
- **Out of Scope:** If the user's request is unrelated to the available capabilities, respond with a `FINAL_ANSWER:` that politely explains you cannot fulfill the request and restates your purpose.
- **CRITICAL: Avoid Repetitive Behavior.** You are a highly intelligent agent. Do not get stuck in a loop by repeating the same tool calls or by cycling through the same set of tools. Once a tool has returned a successful result with data that is relevant to the user's request, do not call that same tool again unless there is a new and compelling reason to do so. If you have called a series of tools and believe you have enough information, you must call a FINAL_ANSWER. Do not repeat tool calls just to be "through".

USER PROMPT:

You are an expert strategic planning assistant. Your task is to analyze a user's request or a complex workflow goal and decompose it into a high-level, phased meta-plan. This plan will serve as a state machine executor.

---
### Critical Directives
You MUST follow these directives in order to create a valid and efficient plan.



1.  **Analyze Goal and Context**: First, carefully read the user's `GOAL` and review the `CONTEXT` section to understand the full intent and what actions have already been taken.
    
    

2.  **Identify Conversational Turns**: If the user's `GOAL` is purely conversational (e.g., a greeting like "hello") and does not require any data or action, your response **MUST be a single JSON object**: `{"plan_type": "conversational", "response": "I'm doing well, thank you for asking! How can I help you with your Teradata database system today?"}`.

3.  **Handle Context and Parameters Correctly**:
    * **Prioritize the Goal**: You **MUST** prioritize entities from the user's current `GOAL` over conflicting information in the `Workflow History`. The history is for supplementing missing information, not for overriding the current request.
    * **Extract Parameters**: You **MUST** meticulously scan the `GOAL` for entities that correspond to tool arguments (e.g., table names) and populate the `"arguments"` block in your plan phase with these key-value pairs.

4.  **Follow the Plan Architecture**:
    * Your plan **MUST** follow a strict "data-gathering first, synthesis last" architecture.
    * If the goal requires a final summary, the plan **MUST** conclude with a single phase that uses the `CoreLLMTask` tool. The `task_description` for this phase **MUST** be the complete and verbatim text of the main `GOAL` to ensure all original context is preserved.

5.  **Optimize for Efficiency**:
    * Your plan **MUST** be as efficient as possible. Combine multiple steps into a single phase if one tool can perform the combined operation.
    * **CRITICAL STRATEGY (Query Pushdown Efficiency)**: Always prefer a single action that filters data at the source over multiple steps that retrieve unfiltered data and then filter it.
        * **HIGHLY PREFERRED:** Use a tool that accepts a filter (e.g., a `sql` parameter with a `WHERE` clause) to request *only the specific data you need*.
        * **AVOID IF POSSIBLE:** Do not use a general-purpose "list" tool and then follow it with a second phase to find a specific item.

6.  **Maintain Simplicity and Focus**:
    * If the `GOAL` can be answered with a single tool call, your plan **MUST** consist of only that single phase. Do not add unnecessary synthesis phases for simple data retrieval.
    * Every phase **MUST** correspond to a concrete, executable action. Do **NOT** create phases for simple verification or acknowledgement.

7.  **Adhere to Structural Rules**:
    * **CRITICAL RULE (Plan Flattening)**: Your plan **MUST ALWAYS** be a flat, sequential list of phases. You **MUST NOT** create nested structures. Decompose tasks with nested logic into multiple, sequential looping phases.
    * **CRITICAL RULE (Capability Type Enforcement)**: Your selection **MUST** strictly adhere to the capability type. You are **forbidden** from placing a `(prompt)` in the `"relevant_tools"` list or a `(tool)` in the `"executable_prompt"` field.

8.  **Ensure Stability**:
    * **CRITICAL RULE (Recursion Prevention)**: Review the `Current Execution Depth`. You **MUST NOT** create a plan that calls an `executable_prompt` if the depth is approaching the maximum of 5. If you are already inside an `Active Prompt`, you **MUST NOT** create a plan that calls that same prompt again.

---
### Plan JSON Structure
Your output **MUST** be a single, valid JSON array of phase objects. Each object must follow this structure:

-   `"phase"`: An integer, starting from 1.
-   `"goal"`: A concise string describing what this phase will accomplish. You MUST embed any relevant parameters from the user's goal directly into this string.
-   `"type"`: (Optional) Use `"loop"` if the phase needs to iterate over the results of a previous phase.
-   `"loop_over"`: (Required if `type` is `"loop"`) A string identifying the source of items to loop over (e.g., `"result_of_phase_1"`).
-   `"relevant_tools"`: A JSON array containing the single string name of the `(tool)` to be used in this phase.
-   `"executable_prompt"`: A string name of the `(prompt)` to be used in this phase.
-   `"arguments"`: (Optional) A JSON object of key-value pairs for the selected capability. You can use placeholders like `"result_of_phase_1"` to pass data between phases.

---
### EXAMPLE (Flattening Nested Logic)
-   **User Goal**: "For each database on the system, get the DDL for all of its tables."
-   **Correct Plan**:
    ```json
    [
      {
        "phase": 1,
        "goal": "First, get a list of all databases on the system.",
        "relevant_tools": ["base_listDatabases"]
      },
      {
        "phase": 2,
        "goal": "Now, loop over the list of databases gathered in Phase 1 and get the list of tables for each one.",
        "type": "loop",
        "loop_over": "result_of_phase_1",
        "relevant_tools": ["base_listTables"]
      },
      {
        "phase": 3,
        "goal": "Finally, loop over the flattened list of tables gathered in Phase 2 and get the DDL for each one.",
        "type": "loop",
        "loop_over": "result_of_phase_2",
        "relevant_tools": ["base_tableDDL"]
      }
    ]

Your task is to create a final report for the user based on the provided data and their original question.\n\n--- INSTRUCTIONS ---\nYour entire response MUST be formatted in standard markdown and MUST be structured as follows:\n\n1.  **(Optional) Key Metric:** If the answer to the user's question can be summarized by a single primary value (either quantitative like a number, or qualitative like a status), you MUST provide it on the very first line in a specific JSON format. The line must start with `Key Metric: ` followed by a JSON object with a `value` (as a string) and a `label` (a short description).\n    - Quantitative Example: `Key Metric: {\"value\": \"21\", \"label\": \"Databases on system\"}`\n    - Qualitative Example: `Key Metric: {\"value\": \"High\", \"label\": \"System Utilization\"}`\n    If there is no single primary value, you MUST omit this line entirely.\n2.  **The Direct Answer:** This part MUST immediately follow the Key Metric (or be the first line if no metric is provided). It must be a single, concise sentence that directly and factually answers the user's question.\n3.  **Key Observations:** This section MUST start with a level-2 markdown heading (`## Key Observations`). It should contain a bulleted list of all supporting details and context.\n4.  **CRITICAL RULE (Observations Content):** The 'Key Observations' section is for **textual insights only**. You **MUST NOT** include raw data, code blocks (like SQL), or titles for data that is presented elsewhere (e.g., 'DDL for table_x:'). Your observations should be narrative sentences that describe what the data means.\n",

The line must start with `Key Metric: ` followed by a JSON object with a `value` (as a string) and a `label` (a short description).\n    - Quantitative Example: `Key Metric: {\"value\": \"21\", \"label\": \"Databases on system\"}`\n    - Qualitative Example: `Key Metric: {\"value\": \"High\", \"label\": \"System Utilization\"}`\n    If there is no single primary value, you MUST omit this line entirely.\n2.  **The Direct Answer:** This part MUST immediately follow the Key Metric (or be the first line if no metric is provided). It must be a single, concise sentence that directly and factually answers the user's question.\n3.  **Key Observations:** This section MUST start with a level-2 markdown heading (`## Key Observations`). It should contain a bulleted list of all supporting details and context.\n4.  **CRITICAL RULE (Observations Content):** The 'Key Observations' section is for **textual insights only**. You **MUST NOT** include raw data, code blocks (like SQL), or titles for data that is presented elsewhere (e.g., 'DDL for table_x:'). Your observations should be narrative sentences that describe what the data means.\n",

You are a highly capable text processing and synthesis assistant.

--- PRIMARY GOAL ---
Your most important task is to directly answer the user's original question: 'what is the detailed physical database design of the fitness database'.
You MUST begin your response with the direct answer. Do not repeat the user's question or use conversational intros like 'Here is...'. After providing the direct answer, you may then proceed with a more general summary or analysis of the data.

--- TASK ---

You are an expert data analyst. Your task is to create a final report for the user based on the provided data and their original question.

--- INSTRUCTIONS ---
Your entire response MUST be formatted in standard markdown and MUST be structured as follows:

1.  **(Optional) Key Metric:** If the answer to the user's question can be summarized by a single primary value (either quantitative like a number, or qualitative like a status), you MUST provide it on the very first line in a specific JSON format. The line must start with `Key Metric: ` followed by a JSON object with a `value` (as a string) and a `label` (a short description).
    - Quantitative Example: `Key Metric: {"value": "21", "label": "Databases on system"}`
    - Qualitative Example: `Key Metric: {"value": "High", "label": "System Utilization"}`
    If there is no single primary value, you MUST omit this line entirely.
2.  **The Direct Answer:** This part MUST immediately follow the Key Metric (or be the first line if no metric is provided). It must be a single, concise sentence that directly and factually answers the user's question.
3.  **Key Observations:** This section MUST start with a level-2 markdown heading (`## Key Observations`). It should contain a bulleted list of all supporting details and context.
4.  **CRITICAL RULE (Observations Content):** The 'Key Observations' section is for **textual insights only**. You **MUST NOT** include raw data, code blocks (like SQL), or titles for data that is presented elsewhere (e.g., 'DDL for table_x:'). Your observations should be narrative sentences that describe what the data means.

    }

}

--- KNOWN CONTEXT ---
The following key information has already been established in previous steps. You MUST use this information to populate header fields like 'Table Name' or 'Database Name'.
- database_name: fitness_db
- table_name: fitness_db.Sales

--- SEMANTIC GUIDANCE ---
When the 'TASK' asks for a 'description', 'analysis', or 'summary', you MUST synthesize new content that reflects the *semantic intent* of the request.
For example:
- If the 'TASK' asks for a 'business description of a table', you MUST explain its purpose from an organizational, functional, or analytical viewpoint, and the business significance of its columns. Do NOT simply reiterate technical DDL (Data Definition Language) information, even if it is present in the `RELEVANT DATA`.
- If the 'TASK' asks for a 'summary of errors', you MUST provide a concise overview of the issues, not just a list of error codes.
Always prioritize generating content that matches the *meaning* and *purpose* of the 'TASK', interpreting the raw data to produce the desired semantic output.

--- CRITICAL RULES ---
1. **Separate Data from Description:** If the 'TASK' requires you to output header fields (like `***Table Name:***` or `***Database Name:***`) AND a main description, you MUST treat these as separate steps. First, populate the header fields using the 'KNOWN CONTEXT'. Then, write the main description. Do NOT merge context data (like the database name) into a single header field.
2. **Content and Formatting Precision:** You MUST adhere to any and all formatting instructions contained in the 'TASK' description with absolute precision. Do not deviate, simplify, or change the requested format in any way. You MUST generate content that genuinely fulfills the semantic goal of the 'TASK'.
3. **Key Name Adherence:** If the 'TASK' description provides an example format, you MUST use the exact key names (e.g., `***Description:***`, `***Table Name:***`) shown in the example. Do not invent new key names or use synonyms like 'Table Description'.
4. **Column Placeholder Replacement:** If the 'TASK' involves describing table columns and the formatting guidelines include a placeholder like `***ColumnX:***` or `***[Column Name]:***`, you MUST replace that placeholder with the actual name of the column you are describing (e.g., `***CUST_ID:***`, `***FIRSTNAME:***`). Do not use generic, numbered placeholders like 'Column1', 'Column2', etc.
5. **Layout and Line Breaks:** Each key-value pair or list item specified in the formatting guidelines MUST be on its own separate line. Do not combine multiple items onto a single line.

Your response should be the direct result of the task. Do not add any conversational text or extra formatting unless explicitly requested by the task description.
[model]: The detailed physical database design of the fitness database includes multiple tables that manages sales, products, service tickets, and customer information.

## Key Observations
*   The `fitness_db` database includes tables for `Sales`, `SaleDetails`, `Products`, `ServiceTickets`, and `Customers`.
*   The `Sales` table contains information about individual sales transactions, linking to `Customers` table via `CustomerID`.
*   The `SaleDetails` table provides details about each sale, specifying the product sold (`ProductID`) and quantity.
*   The `Products` table stores information about the products, including product name, type, brand, price, and stock quantity.
*   The `ServiceTickets` table tracks customer service issues, linking customers and products to the created ticket.
*   The `Customers` table stores customer information such as name, contact details, address and registration date.
[user]: SYSTEM PROMPT:

# Core Directives
You are a specialized assistant for a Teradata database system. Your primary goal is to fulfill user requests by selecting the best capability (a tool or a prompt) from the categorized lists provided and supplying all necessary arguments.

# Response Format
Your response MUST be a single JSON object for a tool/prompt call OR a single plain text string for a final answer.

1.  **Tool/Prompt Calls (JSON format):**
    -   If the capability is a prompt, you MUST use the key `"prompt_name"`.
    -   If the capability is a tool, you MUST use the key `"tool_name"`.
    -   Provide all required arguments. Infer values from the conversation history if necessary.
    -   Example (Prompt): `{"prompt_name": "some_prompt", "arguments": {"arg": "value"}}`
    -   Example (Tool): `{"tool_name": "some_tool", "arguments": {"arg": "value"}}`

2.  **Final Answer (Plain Text format):**
    -   When you have sufficient information to fully answer the user's request, you MUST stop using tools.
    -   Your response MUST begin with the exact prefix `FINAL_ANSWER:`, followed by a natural language summary.
    -   Example: `FINAL_ANSWER: I found 48 databases on the system. The details are displayed below.`

# Decision Process
To select the correct capability, you MUST follow this two-step process, governed by one critical rule:

**CRITICAL RULE: Follow this strict hierarchy for capability selection:**
1.  **Prioritize Pre-defined Analysis/Reports (Prompts):** If the user's request is for an **analysis, description, or summary** that is a strong semantic match for an available `prompt`, you **MUST** select that `prompt_name`. Prompts are the preferred method for generating these pre-defined analytical outputs.
2.  **Default to Direct Actions (Tools):** If no analytical prompt is a direct match, or if the user's request is a direct command (e.g., "list...", "count...", "show me..."), you **MUST** treat the request as a direct action. Select the most specific `tool_name` that fulfills this action.

**CRITICAL RULE (Planner Efficiency):** You **MUST NOT** create a multi-phase plan using tools if the user's goal can be fully achieved by a single, available prompt. If a prompt exists that matches the user's request for an analysis or report, you **MUST** call that prompt directly. Do not create a plan that manually replicates the function of an existing prompt.

# Few-Shot Examples
Here are examples of the correct thinking process:

**Example 1: Direct Action Request**
- **User Query:** "what is the quality of table 'online' in database 'DEMO_Customer360_db'?"
- **Thought Process:**
    1. The user's request is about "quality," but it's a direct question, not a request for a broad "description" or "summary." No prompt for a pre-defined analysis is a perfect match.
    2. Therefore, I move to step 2 of my critical rule: treat this as a direct action.
    3. The user's query is about a **table**. I must choose a table-level tool.
    4. The `qlty_columnSummary` tool takes a `table_name` and is the most specific, correct choice for this direct action.
- **Correct Response:** `{"tool_name": "qlty_columnSummary", "arguments": {"database_name": "DEMO_Customer360_db", "table_name": "online"}}`

**Example 2: Pre-defined Analysis Request**
- **User Query:** "describe the business purpose of the 'DEMO_Customer360_db' database"
- **Thought Process:**
    1. The user's request is for a "business purpose" description, which is a pre-defined analysis. I will check for a matching prompt first.
    2. The `base_databaseBusinessDesc` prompt is described as being for this exact purpose. It is a strong semantic match.
    3. According to my critical rule, I **MUST** select this prompt. I am forbidden from creating a multi-step plan to get the DDL and then summarize it.
- **Correct Response:** `{"prompt_name": "base_databaseBusinessDesc", "arguments": {"database_name": "DEMO_Customer360_db"}}`

# Best Practices
- **Context is Key:** Always use information from previous turns to fill in arguments like `database_name` or `table_name`.
- **Error Recovery:** If a tool fails, analyze the error message and attempt to call the tool again with corrected parameters. Only ask the user for clarification if you cannot recover.
- **SQL Generation:** When using the `base_readQuery` tool, you MUST use fully qualified table names in your SQL (e.g., `SELECT ... FROM my_database.my_table`).
- **Time-Sensitive Queries:** For queries involving relative dates (e.g., 'today', 'this week'), you MUST use the `util_getCurrentDate` tool first to determine the current date before proceeding.
- **Out of Scope:** If the user's request is unrelated to the available capabilities, respond with a `FINAL_ANSWER:` that politely explains you cannot fulfill the request and restates your purpose.
- **CRITICAL: Avoid Repetitive Behavior.** You are a highly intelligent agent. Do not get stuck in a loop by repeating the same tool calls or by cycling through the same set of tools. Once a tool has returned a successful result with data that is relevant to the user's request, do not call that same tool again unless there is a new and compelling reason to do so. If you have called a series of tools and believe you have enough information, you must call a FINAL_ANSWER. Do not repeat tool calls just to be "through".

USER PROMPT:

You are an expert strategic planning assistant. Your task is to analyze a user's request or a complex workflow goal and decompose it into a high-level, phased meta-plan. This plan will serve as a state machine executor.

---
### Critical Directives
You MUST follow these directives in order to create a valid and efficient plan.



1.  **Analyze Goal and Context**: First, carefully read the user's `GOAL` and review the `CONTEXT` section to understand the full intent and what actions have already been taken.
    
    

2.  **Identify Conversational Turns**: If the user's `GOAL` is purely conversational (e.g., a greeting like "hello") and does not require any data or action, your response **MUST be a single JSON object**: `{"plan_type": "conversational", "response": "I'm doing well, thank you for asking! How can I help you with your Teradata database system today?"}`.

3.  **Handle Context and Parameters Correctly**:
    * **Prioritize the Goal**: You **MUST** prioritize entities from the user's current `GOAL` over conflicting information in the `Workflow History`. The history is for supplementing missing information, not for overriding the current request.
    * **Extract Parameters**: You **MUST** meticulously scan the `GOAL` for entities that correspond to tool arguments (e.g., table names) and populate the `"arguments"` block in your plan phase with these key-value pairs.

4.  **Follow the Plan Architecture**:
    * Your plan **MUST** follow a strict "data-gathering first, synthesis last" architecture.
    * If the goal requires a final summary, the plan **MUST** conclude with a single phase that uses the `CoreLLMTask` tool. The `task_description` for this phase **MUST** be the complete and verbatim text of the main `GOAL` to ensure all original context is preserved.

5.  **Optimize for Efficiency**:
    * Your plan **MUST** be as efficient as possible. Combine multiple steps into a single phase if one tool can perform the combined operation.
    * **CRITICAL STRATEGY (Query Pushdown Efficiency)**: Always prefer a single action that filters data at the source over multiple steps that retrieve unfiltered data and then filter it.
        * **HIGHLY PREFERRED:** Use a tool that accepts a filter (e.g., a `sql` parameter with a `WHERE` clause) to request *only the specific data you need*.
        * **AVOID IF POSSIBLE:** Do not use a general-purpose "list" tool and then follow it with a second phase to find a specific item.

6.  **Maintain Simplicity and Focus**:
    * If the `GOAL` can be answered with a single tool call, your plan **MUST** consist of only that single phase. Do not add unnecessary synthesis phases for simple data retrieval.
    * Every phase **MUST** correspond to a concrete, executable action. Do **NOT** create phases for simple verification or acknowledgement.

7.  **Adhere to Structural Rules**:
    * **CRITICAL RULE (Plan Flattening)**: Your plan **MUST ALWAYS** be a flat, sequential list of phases. You **MUST NOT** create nested structures. Decompose tasks with nested logic into multiple, sequential looping phases.
    * **CRITICAL RULE (Capability Type Enforcement)**: Your selection **MUST** strictly adhere to the capability type. You are **forbidden** from placing a `(prompt)` in the `"relevant_tools"` list or a `(tool)` in the `"executable_prompt"` field.

8.  **Ensure Stability**:
    * **CRITICAL RULE (Recursion Prevention)**: Review the `Current Execution Depth`. You **MUST NOT** create a plan that calls an `executable_prompt` if the depth is approaching the maximum of 5. If you are already inside an `Active Prompt`, you **MUST NOT** create a plan that calls that same prompt again.

---
### Plan JSON Structure
Your output **MUST** be a single, valid JSON array of phase objects. Each object must follow this structure:

-   `"phase"`: An integer, starting from 1.
-   `"goal"`: A concise string describing what this phase will accomplish. You MUST embed any relevant parameters from the user's goal directly into this string.
-   `"type"`: (Optional) Use `"loop"` if the phase needs to iterate over the results of a previous phase.
-   `"loop_over"`: (Required if `type` is `"loop"`) A string identifying the source of items to loop over (e.g., `"result_of_phase_1"`).
-   `"relevant_tools"`: A JSON array containing the single string name of the `(tool)` to be used in this phase.
-   `"executable_prompt"`: A string name of the `(prompt)` to be used in this phase.
-   `"arguments"`: (Optional) A JSON object of key-value pairs for the selected capability. You can use placeholders like `"result_of_phase_1"` to pass data between phases.

---
### EXAMPLE (Flattening Nested Logic)
-   **User Goal**: "For each database on the system, get the DDL for all of its tables."
-   **Correct Plan**:
    ```json
    [
      {
        "phase": 1,
        "goal": "First, get a list of all databases on the system.",
        "relevant_tools": ["base_listDatabases"]
      },
      {
        "phase": 2,
        "goal": "Now, loop over the list of databases gathered in Phase 1 and get the list of tables for each one.",
        "type": "loop",
        "loop_over": "result_of_phase_1",
        "relevant_tools": ["base_listTables"]
      },
      {
        "phase": 3,
        "goal": "Finally, loop over the flattened list of tables gathered in Phase 2 and get the DDL for each one.",
        "type": "loop",
        "loop_over": "result_of_phase_2",
        "relevant_tools": ["base_tableDDL"]
      }
    ]

Your task is to create a final report for the user based on the provided data and their original question.\n\n--- INSTRUCTIONS ---\nYour entire response MUST be formatted in standard markdown and MUST be structured as follows:\n\n1.  **(Optional) Key Metric:** If the answer to the user's question can be summarized by a single primary value (either quantitative like a number, or qualitative like a status), you MUST provide it on the very first line in a specific JSON format. The line must start with `Key Metric: ` followed by a JSON object with a `value` (as a string) and a `label` (a short description).\n    - Quantitative Example: `Key Metric: {\"value\": \"21\", \"label\": \"Databases on system\"}`\n    - Qualitative Example: `Key Metric: {\"value\": \"High\", \"label\": \"System Utilization\"}`\n    If there is no single primary value, you MUST omit this line entirely.\n2.  **The Direct Answer:** This part MUST immediately follow the Key Metric (or be the first line if no metric is provided). It must be a single, concise sentence that directly and factually answers the user's question.\n3.  **Key Observations:** This section MUST start with a level-2 markdown heading (`## Key Observations`). It should contain a bulleted list of all supporting details and context.\n4.  **CRITICAL RULE (Observations Content):** The 'Key Observations' section is for **textual insights only**. You **MUST NOT** include raw data, code blocks (like SQL), or titles for data that is presented elsewhere (e.g., 'DDL for table_x:'). Your observations should be narrative sentences that describe what the data means.\n",

--- INSTRUCTIONS ---
1.  **Analyze the Error**: Read the "Error Message" to understand why the tool failed. Common reasons include missing arguments (like `database_name`), incorrect values, or formatting issues.
2.  **Consult the Definition**: Look at the "Tool Definition" to see the correct names and requirements for all arguments.
3.  **Use History**: Use the "Full Conversation History" to find correct values for any missing arguments.
4.  **Generate Correction**: Create a new, valid set of arguments for the tool.

Your response MUST be ONLY a single JSON object containing the corrected `arguments`.
Example format:
```json
{
  "arguments": {
    "database_name": "some_database",
    "table_name": "some_table"
  }
}
```


2025-09-06 11:01:48,688 - --- FULL CONTEXT (Session: f704e2b4-a2f8-4aa6-83ca-062a693801e2) ---
--- REASON FOR CALL ---
Executing CoreLLMTask: 
You are an expert data analyst. Your task is to create a final report for the user based on the provided data and their original question.

--- INSTRUCTIONS ---
Your entire response MUST be formatted in standard markdown and MUST be structured as follows:

1.  **(Optional) Key Metric:** If the answer to the user's question can be summarized by a single primary value (either quantitative like a number, or qualitative like a status), you MUST provide it on the very first line in a specific JSON format. The line must start with `Key Metric: ` followed by a JSON object with a `value` (as a string) and a `label` (a short description).
    - Quantitative Example: `Key Metric: {"value": "21", "label": "Databases on system"}`
    - Qualitative Example: `Key Metric: {"value": "High", "label": "System Utilization"}`
    If there is no single primary value, you MUST omit this line entirely.
2.  **The Direct Answer:** This part MUST immediately follow the Key Metric (or be the first line if no metric is provided). It must be a single, concise sentence that directly and factually answers the user's question.
3.  **Key Observations:** This section MUST start with a level-2 markdown heading (`## Key Observations`). It should contain a bulleted list of all supporting details and context.
4.  **CRITICAL RULE (Observations Content):** The 'Key Observations' section is for **textual insights only**. You **MUST NOT** include raw data, code blocks (like SQL), or titles for data that is presented elsewhere (e.g., 'DDL for table_x:'). Your observations should be narrative sentences that describe what the data means.


--- History (History Disabled for LLM Call: False) ---
[user]: You are a helpful assistant.
[model]: Understood.
[user]: SYSTEM PROMPT:

# Core Directives
You are a specialized assistant for a Teradata database system. Your primary goal is to fulfill user requests by selecting the best capability (a tool or a prompt) from the categorized lists provided and supplying all necessary arguments.

# Response Format
Your response MUST be a single JSON object for a tool/prompt call OR a single plain text string for a final answer.

1.  **Tool/Prompt Calls (JSON format):**
    -   If the capability is a prompt, you MUST use the key `"prompt_name"`.
    -   If the capability is a tool, you MUST use the key `"tool_name"`.
    -   Provide all required arguments. Infer values from the conversation history if necessary.
    -   Example (Prompt): `{"prompt_name": "some_prompt", "arguments": {"arg": "value"}}`
    -   Example (Tool): `{"tool_name": "some_tool", "arguments": {"arg": "value"}}`

2.  **Final Answer (Plain Text format):**
    -   When you have sufficient information to fully answer the user's request, you MUST stop using tools.
    -   Your response MUST begin with the exact prefix `FINAL_ANSWER:`, followed by a natural language summary.
    -   Example: `FINAL_ANSWER: I found 48 databases on the system. The details are displayed below.`

# Decision Process
To select the correct capability, you MUST follow this two-step process, governed by one critical rule:

**CRITICAL RULE: Follow this strict hierarchy for capability selection:**
1.  **Prioritize Pre-defined Analysis/Reports (Prompts):** If the user's request is for an **analysis, description, or summary** that is a strong semantic match for an available `prompt`, you **MUST** select that `prompt_name`. Prompts are the preferred method for generating these pre-defined analytical outputs.
2.  **Default to Direct Actions (Tools):** If no analytical prompt is a direct match, or if the user's request is a direct command (e.g., "list...", "count...", "show me..."), you **MUST** treat the request as a direct action. Select the most specific `tool_name` that fulfills this action.

**CRITICAL RULE (Planner Efficiency):** You **MUST NOT** create a multi-phase plan using tools if the user's goal can be fully achieved by a single, available prompt. If a prompt exists that matches the user's request for an analysis or report, you **MUST** call that prompt directly. Do not create a plan that manually replicates the function of an existing prompt.

# Few-Shot Examples
Here are examples of the correct thinking process:

**Example 1: Direct Action Request**
- **User Query:** "what is the quality of table 'online' in database 'DEMO_Customer360_db'?"
- **Thought Process:**
    1. The user's request is about "quality," but it's a direct question, not a request for a broad "description" or "summary." No prompt for a pre-defined analysis is a perfect match.
    2. Therefore, I move to step 2 of my critical rule: treat this as a direct action.
    3. The user's query is about a **table**. I must choose a table-level tool.
    4. The `qlty_columnSummary` tool takes a `table_name` and is the most specific, correct choice for this direct action.
- **Correct Response:** `{"tool_name": "qlty_columnSummary", "arguments": {"database_name": "DEMO_Customer360_db", "table_name": "online"}}`

**Example 2: Pre-defined Analysis Request**
- **User Query:** "describe the business purpose of the 'DEMO_Customer360_db' database"
- **Thought Process:**
    1. The user's request is for a "business purpose" description, which is a pre-defined analysis. I will check for a matching prompt first.
    2. The `base_databaseBusinessDesc` prompt is described as being for this exact purpose. It is a strong semantic match.
    3. According to my critical rule, I **MUST** select this prompt. I am forbidden from creating a multi-step plan to get the DDL and then summarize it.
- **Correct Response:** `{"prompt_name": "base_databaseBusinessDesc", "arguments": {"database_name": "DEMO_Customer360_db"}}`

# Best Practices
- **Context is Key:** Always use information from previous turns to fill in arguments like `database_name` or `table_name`.
- **Error Recovery:** If a tool fails, analyze the error message and attempt to call the tool again with corrected parameters. Only ask the user for clarification if you cannot recover.
- **SQL Generation:** When using the `base_readQuery` tool, you MUST use fully qualified table names in your SQL (e.g., `SELECT ... FROM my_database.my_table`).
- **Time-Sensitive Queries:** For queries involving relative dates (e.g., 'today', 'this week'), you MUST use the `util_getCurrentDate` tool first to determine the current date before proceeding.
- **Out of Scope:** If the user's request is unrelated to the available capabilities, respond with a `FINAL_ANSWER:` that politely explains you cannot fulfill the request and restates your purpose.
- **CRITICAL: Avoid Repetitive Behavior.** You are a highly intelligent agent. Do not get stuck in a loop by repeating the same tool calls or by cycling through the same set of tools. Once a tool has returned a successful result with data that is relevant to the user's request, do not call that same tool again unless there is a new and compelling reason to do so. If you have called a series of tools and believe you have enough information, you must call a FINAL_ANSWER. Do not repeat tool calls just to be "through".

USER PROMPT:

You are an expert strategic planning assistant. Your task is to analyze a user's request or a complex workflow goal and decompose it into a high-level, phased meta-plan. This plan will serve as a state machine executor.

---
### Critical Directives
You MUST follow these directives in order to create a valid and efficient plan.



1.  **Analyze Goal and Context**: First, carefully read the user's `GOAL` and review the `CONTEXT` section to understand the full intent and what actions have already been taken.
    
    

2.  **Identify Conversational Turns**: If the user's `GOAL` is purely conversational (e.g., a greeting like "hello") and does not require any data or action, your response **MUST be a single JSON object**: `{"plan_type": "conversational", "response": "I'm doing well, thank you for asking! How can I help you with your Teradata database system today?"}`.

3.  **Handle Context and Parameters Correctly**:
    * **Prioritize the Goal**: You **MUST** prioritize entities from the user's current `GOAL` over conflicting information in the `Workflow History`. The history is for supplementing missing information, not for overriding the current request.
    * **Extract Parameters**: You **MUST** meticulously scan the `GOAL` for entities that correspond to tool arguments (e.g., table names) and populate the `"arguments"` block in your plan phase with these key-value pairs.

4.  **Follow the Plan Architecture**:
    * Your plan **MUST** follow a strict "data-gathering first, synthesis last" architecture.
    * If the goal requires a final summary, the plan **MUST** conclude with a single phase that uses the `CoreLLMTask` tool. The `task_description` for this phase **MUST** be the complete and verbatim text of the main `GOAL` to ensure all original context is preserved.

5.  **Optimize for Efficiency**:
    * Your plan **MUST** be as efficient as possible. Combine multiple steps into a single phase if one tool can perform the combined operation.
    * **CRITICAL STRATEGY (Query Pushdown Efficiency)**: Always prefer a single action that filters data at the source over multiple steps that retrieve unfiltered data and then filter it.
        * **HIGHLY PREFERRED:** Use a tool that accepts a filter (e.g., a `sql` parameter with a `WHERE` clause) to request *only the specific data you need*.
        * **AVOID IF POSSIBLE:** Do not use a general-purpose "list" tool and then follow it with a second phase to find a specific item.

6.  **Maintain Simplicity and Focus**:
    * If the `GOAL` can be answered with a single tool call, your plan **MUST** consist of only that single phase. Do not add unnecessary synthesis phases for simple data retrieval.
    * Every phase **MUST** correspond to a concrete, executable action. Do **NOT** create phases for simple verification or acknowledgement.

7.  **Adhere to Structural Rules**:
    * **CRITICAL RULE (Plan Flattening)**: Your plan **MUST ALWAYS** be a flat, sequential list of phases. You **MUST NOT** create nested structures. Decompose tasks with nested logic into multiple, sequential looping phases.
    * **CRITICAL RULE (Capability Type Enforcement)**: Your selection **MUST** strictly adhere to the capability type. You are **forbidden** from placing a `(prompt)` in the `"relevant_tools"` list or a `(tool)` in the `"executable_prompt"` field.

8.  **Ensure Stability**:
    * **CRITICAL RULE (Recursion Prevention)**: Review the `Current Execution Depth`. You **MUST NOT** create a plan that calls an `executable_prompt` if the depth is approaching the maximum of 5. If you are already inside an `Active Prompt`, you **MUST NOT** create a plan that calls that same prompt again.

---
### Plan JSON Structure
Your output **MUST** be a single, valid JSON array of phase objects. Each object must follow this structure:

-   `"phase"`: An integer, starting from 1.
-   `"goal"`: A concise string describing what this phase will accomplish. You MUST embed any relevant parameters from the user's goal directly into this string.
-   `"type"`: (Optional) Use `"loop"` if the phase needs to iterate over the results of a previous phase.
-   `"loop_over"`: (Required if `type` is `"loop"`) A string identifying the source of items to loop over (e.g., `"result_of_phase_1"`).
-   `"relevant_tools"`: A JSON array containing the single string name of the `(tool)` to be used in this phase.
-   `"executable_prompt"`: A string name of the `(prompt)` to be used in this phase.
-   `"arguments"`: (Optional) A JSON object of key-value pairs for the selected capability. You can use placeholders like `"result_of_phase_1"` to pass data between phases.

---
### EXAMPLE (Flattening Nested Logic)
-   **User Goal**: "For each database on the system, get the DDL for all of its tables."
-   **Correct Plan**:
    ```json
    [
      {
        "phase": 1,
        "goal": "First, get a list of all databases on the system.",
        "relevant_tools": ["base_listDatabases"]
      },
      {
        "phase": 2,
        "goal": "Now, loop over the list of databases gathered in Phase 1 and get the list of tables for each one.",
        "type": "loop",
        "loop_over": "result_of_phase_1",
        "relevant_tools": ["base_listTables"]
      },
      {
        "phase": 3,
        "goal": "Finally, loop over the flattened list of tables gathered in Phase 2 and get the DDL for each one.",
        "type": "loop",
        "loop_over": "result_of_phase_2",
        "relevant_tools": ["base_tableDDL"]
      }
    ]

```
[user]: SYSTEM PROMPT:
You are a text processing and synthesis assistant.

USER PROMPT:
You are a highly capable text processing and synthesis assistant.

--- PRIMARY GOAL ---
Your most important task is to directly answer the user's original question: 'is there a fitness database on the system'.
You MUST begin your response with the direct answer. Do not repeat the user's question or use conversational intros like 'Here is...'. After providing the direct answer, you may then proceed with a more general summary or analysis of the data.

--- TASK ---

You are an expert data analyst. Your task is to create a final report for the user based on the provided data and their original question.

--- INSTRUCTIONS ---
Your entire response MUST be formatted in standard markdown and MUST be structured as follows:

1.  **(Optional) Key Metric:** If the answer to the user's question can be summarized by a single primary value (either quantitative like a number, or qualitative like a status), you MUST provide it on the very first line in a specific JSON format. The line must start with `Key Metric: ` followed by a JSON object with a `value` (as a string) and a `label` (a short description).
    - Quantitative Example: `Key Metric: {"value": "21", "label": "Databases on system"}`
    - Qualitative Example: `Key Metric: {"value": "High", "label": "System Utilization"}`
    If there is no single primary value, you MUST omit this line entirely.
2.  **The Direct Answer:** This part MUST immediately follow the Key Metric (or be the first line if no metric is provided). It must be a single, concise sentence that directly and factually answers the user's question.
3.  **Key Observations:** This section MUST start with a level-2 markdown heading (`## Key Observations`). It should contain a bulleted list of all supporting details and context.
4.  **CRITICAL RULE (Observations Content):** The 'Key Observations' section is for **textual insights only**. You **MUST NOT** include raw data, code blocks (like SQL), or titles for data that is presented elsewhere (e.g., 'DDL for table_x:'). Your observations should be narrative sentences that describe what the data means.

--- KNOWN CONTEXT ---
The following key information has already been established in previous steps. You MUST use this information to populate header fields like 'Table Name' or 'Database Name'.
None

--- SEMANTIC GUIDANCE ---
When the 'TASK' asks for a 'description', 'analysis', or 'summary', you MUST synthesize new content that reflects the *semantic intent* of the request.
For example:
- If the 'TASK' asks for a 'business description of a table', you MUST explain its purpose from an organizational, functional, or analytical viewpoint, and the business significance of its columns. Do NOT simply reiterate technical DDL (Data Definition Language) information, even if it is present in the `RELEVANT DATA`.
- If the 'TASK' asks for a 'summary of errors', you MUST provide a concise overview of the issues, not just a list of error codes.
Always prioritize generating content that matches the *meaning* and *purpose* of the 'TASK', interpreting the raw data to produce the desired semantic output.

--- CRITICAL RULES ---
1. **Separate Data from Description:** If the 'TASK' requires you to output header fields (like `***Table Name:***` or `***Database Name:***`) AND a main description, you MUST treat these as separate steps. First, populate the header fields using the 'KNOWN CONTEXT'. Then, write the main description. Do NOT merge context data (like the database name) into a single header field.
2. **Content and Formatting Precision:** You MUST adhere to any and all formatting instructions contained in the 'TASK' description with absolute precision. Do not deviate, simplify, or change the requested format in any way. You MUST generate content that genuinely fulfills the semantic goal of the 'TASK'.
3. **Key Name Adherence:** If the 'TASK' description provides an example format, you MUST use the exact key names (e.g., `***Description:***`, `***Table Name:***`) shown in the example. Do not invent new key names or use synonyms like 'Table Description'.
4. **Column Placeholder Replacement:** If the 'TASK' involves describing table columns and the formatting guidelines include a placeholder like `***ColumnX:***` or `***[Column Name]:***`, you MUST replace that placeholder with the actual name of the column you are describing (e.g., `***CUST_ID:***`, `***FIRSTNAME:***`). Do not use generic, numbered placeholders like 'Column1', 'Column2', etc.
5. **Layout and Line Breaks:** Each key-value pair or list item specified in the formatting guidelines MUST be on its own separate line. Do not combine multiple items onto a single line.

Your response should be the direct result of the task. Do not add any conversational text or extra formatting unless explicitly requested by the task description.
[model]: Key Metric: {"value": "true", "label": "Fitness database exists"}
Yes, there is a fitness database on the system.

## Key Observations
*   The `base_databaseList` tool returned a list of 47 databases.
*   One of the databases in the list is named `fitness_db` and is of type `DataBase`.
*   The `fitness_db` database has a comment string value of `None`.
[user]: SYSTEM PROMPT:

# Core Directives
You are a specialized assistant for a Teradata database system. Your primary goal is to fulfill user requests by selecting the best capability (a tool or a prompt) from the categorized lists provided and supplying all necessary arguments.

# Response Format
Your response MUST be a single JSON object for a tool/prompt call OR a single plain text string for a final answer.

1.  **Tool/Prompt Calls (JSON format):**
    -   If the capability is a prompt, you MUST use the key `"prompt_name"`.
    -   If the capability is a tool, you MUST use the key `"tool_name"`.
    -   Provide all required arguments. Infer values from the conversation history if necessary.
    -   Example (Prompt): `{"prompt_name": "some_prompt", "arguments": {"arg": "value"}}`
    -   Example (Tool): `{"tool_name": "some_tool", "arguments": {"arg": "value"}}`

2.  **Final Answer (Plain Text format):**
    -   When you have sufficient information to fully answer the user's request, you MUST stop using tools.
    -   Your response MUST begin with the exact prefix `FINAL_ANSWER:`, followed by a natural language summary.
    -   Example: `FINAL_ANSWER: I found 48 databases on the system. The details are displayed below.`

# Decision Process
To select the correct capability, you MUST follow this two-step process, governed by one critical rule:

**CRITICAL RULE: Follow this strict hierarchy for capability selection:**
1.  **Prioritize Pre-defined Analysis/Reports (Prompts):** If the user's request is for an **analysis, description, or summary** that is a strong semantic match for an available `prompt`, you **MUST** select that `prompt_name`. Prompts are the preferred method for generating these pre-defined analytical outputs.
2.  **Default to Direct Actions (Tools):** If no analytical prompt is a direct match, or if the user's request is a direct command (e.g., "list...", "count...", "show me..."), you **MUST** treat the request as a direct action. Select the most specific `tool_name` that fulfills this action.

**CRITICAL RULE (Planner Efficiency):** You **MUST NOT** create a multi-phase plan using tools if the user's goal can be fully achieved by a single, available prompt. If a prompt exists that matches the user's request for an analysis or report, you **MUST** call that prompt directly. Do not create a plan that manually replicates the function of an existing prompt.

# Few-Shot Examples
Here are examples of the correct thinking process:

**Example 1: Direct Action Request**
- **User Query:** "what is the quality of table 'online' in database 'DEMO_Customer360_db'?"
- **Thought Process:**
    1. The user's request is about "quality," but it's a direct question, not a request for a broad "description" or "summary." No prompt for a pre-defined analysis is a perfect match.
    2. Therefore, I move to step 2 of my critical rule: treat this as a direct action.
    3. The user's query is about a **table**. I must choose a table-level tool.
    4. The `qlty_columnSummary` tool takes a `table_name` and is the most specific, correct choice for this direct action.
- **Correct Response:** `{"tool_name": "qlty_columnSummary", "arguments": {"database_name": "DEMO_Customer360_db", "table_name": "online"}}`

**Example 2: Pre-defined Analysis Request**
- **User Query:** "describe the business purpose of the 'DEMO_Customer360_db' database"
- **Thought Process:**
    1. The user's request is for a "business purpose" description, which is a pre-defined analysis. I will check for a matching prompt first.
    2. The `base_databaseBusinessDesc` prompt is described as being for this exact purpose. It is a strong semantic match.
    3. According to my critical rule, I **MUST** select this prompt. I am forbidden from creating a multi-step plan to get the DDL and then summarize it.
- **Correct Response:** `{"prompt_name": "base_databaseBusinessDesc", "arguments": {"database_name": "DEMO_Customer360_db"}}`

# Best Practices
- **Context is Key:** Always use information from previous turns to fill in arguments like `database_name` or `table_name`.
- **Error Recovery:** If a tool fails, analyze the error message and attempt to call the tool again with corrected parameters. Only ask the user for clarification if you cannot recover.
- **SQL Generation:** When using the `base_readQuery` tool, you MUST use fully qualified table names in your SQL (e.g., `SELECT ... FROM my_database.my_table`).
- **Time-Sensitive Queries:** For queries involving relative dates (e.g., 'today', 'this week'), you MUST use the `util_getCurrentDate` tool first to determine the current date before proceeding.
- **Out of Scope:** If the user's request is unrelated to the available capabilities, respond with a `FINAL_ANSWER:` that politely explains you cannot fulfill the request and restates your purpose.
- **CRITICAL: Avoid Repetitive Behavior.** You are a highly intelligent agent. Do not get stuck in a loop by repeating the same tool calls or by cycling through the same set of tools. Once a tool has returned a successful result with data that is relevant to the user's request, do not call that same tool again unless there is a new and compelling reason to do so. If you have called a series of tools and believe you have enough information, you must call a FINAL_ANSWER. Do not repeat tool calls just to be "through".

USER PROMPT:

You are an expert strategic planning assistant. Your task is to analyze a user's request or a complex workflow goal and decompose it into a high-level, phased meta-plan. This plan will serve as a state machine executor.

---
### Critical Directives
You MUST follow these directives in order to create a valid and efficient plan.



1.  **Analyze Goal and Context**: First, carefully read the user's `GOAL` and review the `CONTEXT` section to understand the full intent and what actions have already been taken.
    
    

2.  **Identify Conversational Turns**: If the user's `GOAL` is purely conversational (e.g., a greeting like "hello") and does not require any data or action, your response **MUST be a single JSON object**: `{"plan_type": "conversational", "response": "I'm doing well, thank you for asking! How can I help you with your Teradata database system today?"}`.

3.  **Handle Context and Parameters Correctly**:
    * **Prioritize the Goal**: You **MUST** prioritize entities from the user's current `GOAL` over conflicting information in the `Workflow History`. The history is for supplementing missing information, not for overriding the current request.
    * **Extract Parameters**: You **MUST** meticulously scan the `GOAL` for entities that correspond to tool arguments (e.g., table names) and populate the `"arguments"` block in your plan phase with these key-value pairs.

4.  **Follow the Plan Architecture**:
    * Your plan **MUST** follow a strict "data-gathering first, synthesis last" architecture.
    * If the goal requires a final summary, the plan **MUST** conclude with a single phase that uses the `CoreLLMTask` tool. The `task_description` for this phase **MUST** be the complete and verbatim text of the main `GOAL` to ensure all original context is preserved.

5.  **Optimize for Efficiency**:
    * Your plan **MUST** be as efficient as possible. Combine multiple steps into a single phase if one tool can perform the combined operation.
    * **CRITICAL STRATEGY (Query Pushdown Efficiency)**: Always prefer a single action that filters data at the source over multiple steps that retrieve unfiltered data and then filter it.
        * **HIGHLY PREFERRED:** Use a tool that accepts a filter (e.g., a `sql` parameter with a `WHERE` clause) to request *only the specific data you need*.
        * **AVOID IF POSSIBLE:** Do not use a general-purpose "list" tool and then follow it with a second phase to find a specific item.

6.  **Maintain Simplicity and Focus**:
    * If the `GOAL` can be answered with a single tool call, your plan **MUST** consist of only that single phase. Do not add unnecessary synthesis phases for simple data retrieval.
    * Every phase **MUST** correspond to a concrete, executable action. Do **NOT** create phases for simple verification or acknowledgement.

7.  **Adhere to Structural Rules**:
    * **CRITICAL RULE (Plan Flattening)**: Your plan **MUST ALWAYS** be a flat, sequential list of phases. You **MUST NOT** create nested structures. Decompose tasks with nested logic into multiple, sequential looping phases.
    * **CRITICAL RULE (Capability Type Enforcement)**: Your selection **MUST** strictly adhere to the capability type. You are **forbidden** from placing a `(prompt)` in the `"relevant_tools"` list or a `(tool)` in the `"executable_prompt"` field.

8.  **Ensure Stability**:
    * **CRITICAL RULE (Recursion Prevention)**: Review the `Current Execution Depth`. You **MUST NOT** create a plan that calls an `executable_prompt` if the depth is approaching the maximum of 5. If you are already inside an `Active Prompt`, you **MUST NOT** create a plan that calls that same prompt again.

---
### Plan JSON Structure
Your output **MUST** be a single, valid JSON array of phase objects. Each object must follow this structure:

-   `"phase"`: An integer, starting from 1.
-   `"goal"`: A concise string describing what this phase will accomplish. You MUST embed any relevant parameters from the user's goal directly into this string.
-   `"type"`: (Optional) Use `"loop"` if the phase needs to iterate over the results of a previous phase.
-   `"loop_over"`: (Required if `type` is `"loop"`) A string identifying the source of items to loop over (e.g., `"result_of_phase_1"`).
-   `"relevant_tools"`: A JSON array containing the single string name of the `(tool)` to be used in this phase.
-   `"executable_prompt"`: A string name of the `(prompt)` to be used in this phase.
-   `"arguments"`: (Optional) A JSON object of key-value pairs for the selected capability. You can use placeholders like `"result_of_phase_1"` to pass data between phases.

---
### EXAMPLE (Flattening Nested Logic)
-   **User Goal**: "For each database on the system, get the DDL for all of its tables."
-   **Correct Plan**:
    ```json
    [
      {
        "phase": 1,
        "goal": "First, get a list of all databases on the system.",
        "relevant_tools": ["base_listDatabases"]
      },
      {
        "phase": 2,
        "goal": "Now, loop over the list of databases gathered in Phase 1 and get the list of tables for each one.",
        "type": "loop",
        "loop_over": "result_of_phase_1",
        "relevant_tools": ["base_listTables"]
      },
      {
        "phase": 3,
        "goal": "Finally, loop over the flattened list of tables gathered in Phase 2 and get the DDL for each one.",
        "type": "loop",
        "loop_over": "result_of_phase_2",
        "relevant_tools": ["base_tableDDL"]
      }
    ]

Your task is to create a final report for the user based on the provided data and their original question.\n\n--- INSTRUCTIONS ---\nYour entire response MUST be formatted in standard markdown and MUST be structured as follows:\n\n1.  **(Optional) Key Metric:** If the answer to the user's question can be summarized by a single primary value (either quantitative like a number, or qualitative like a status), you MUST provide it on the very first line in a specific JSON format. The line must start with `Key Metric: ` followed by a JSON object with a `value` (as a string) and a `label` (a short description).\n    - Quantitative Example: `Key Metric: {\"value\": \"21\", \"label\": \"Databases on system\"}`\n    - Qualitative Example: `Key Metric: {\"value\": \"High\", \"label\": \"System Utilization\"}`\n    If there is no single primary value, you MUST omit this line entirely.\n2.  **The Direct Answer:** This part MUST immediately follow the Key Metric (or be the first line if no metric is provided). It must be a single, concise sentence that directly and factually answers the user's question.\n3.  **Key Observations:** This section MUST start with a level-2 markdown heading (`## Key Observations`). It should contain a bulleted list of all supporting details and context.\n4.  **CRITICAL RULE (Observations Content):** The 'Key Observations' section is for **textual insights only**. You **MUST NOT** include raw data, code blocks (like SQL), or titles for data that is presented elsewhere (e.g., 'DDL for table_x:'). Your observations should be narrative sentences that describe what the data means.\n",

Your task is to create a final report for the user based on the provided data and their original question.\n\n--- INSTRUCTIONS ---\nYour entire response MUST be formatted in standard markdown and MUST be structured as follows:\n\n1.  **(Optional) Key Metric:** If the answer to the user's question can be summarized by a single primary value (either quantitative like a number, or qualitative like a status), you MUST provide it on the very first line in a specific JSON format. The line must start with `Key Metric: ` followed by a JSON object with a `value` (as a string) and a `label` (a short description).\n    - Quantitative Example: `Key Metric: {\"value\": \"21\", \"label\": \"Databases on system\"}`\n    - Qualitative Example: `Key Metric: {\"value\": \"High\", \"label\": \"System Utilization\"}`\n    If there is no single primary value, you MUST omit this line entirely.\n2.  **The Direct Answer:** This part MUST immediately follow the Key Metric (or be the first line if no metric is provided). It must be a single, concise sentence that directly and factually answers the user's question.\n3.  **Key Observations:** This section MUST start with a level-2 markdown heading (`## Key Observations`). It should contain a bulleted list of all supporting details and context.\n4.  **CRITICAL RULE (Observations Content):** The 'Key Observations' section is for **textual insights only**. You **MUST NOT** include raw data, code blocks (like SQL), or titles for data that is presented elsewhere (e.g., 'DDL for table_x:'). Your observations should be narrative sentences that describe what the data means.\n",

[user]: SYSTEM PROMPT:
You are a text processing and synthesis assistant.

USER PROMPT:
You are a highly capable text processing and synthesis assistant.

--- PRIMARY GOAL ---
Your most important task is to directly answer the user's original question: 'what is the detailed physical database to sign off the fitness database'.
You MUST begin your response with the direct answer. Do not repeat the user's question or use conversational intros like 'Here is...'. After providing the direct answer, you may then proceed with a more general summary or analysis of the data.

--- TASK ---

You are an expert data analyst. Your task is to create a final report for the user based on the provided data and their original question.

--- INSTRUCTIONS ---
Your entire response MUST be formatted in standard markdown and MUST be structured as follows:

1.  **(Optional) Key Metric:** If the answer to the user's question can be summarized by a single primary value (either quantitative like a number, or qualitative like a status), you MUST provide it on the very first line in a specific JSON format. The line must start with `Key Metric: ` followed by a JSON object with a `value` (as a string) and a `label` (a short description).
    - Quantitative Example: `Key Metric: {"value": "21", "label": "Databases on system"}`
    - Qualitative Example: `Key Metric: {"value": "High", "label": "System Utilization"}`
    If there is no single primary value, you MUST omit this line entirely.
2.  **The Direct Answer:** This part MUST immediately follow the Key Metric (or be the first line if no metric is provided). It must be a single, concise sentence that directly and factually answers the user's question.
3.  **Key Observations:** This section MUST start with a level-2 markdown heading (`## Key Observations`). It should contain a bulleted list of all supporting details and context.
4.  **CRITICAL RULE (Observations Content):** The 'Key Observations' section is for **textual insights only**. You **MUST NOT** include raw data, code blocks (like SQL), or titles for data that is presented elsewhere (e.g., 'DDL for table_x:'). Your observations should be narrative sentences that describe what the data means.

--- KNOWN CONTEXT ---
The following key information has already been established in previous steps. You MUST use this information to populate header fields like 'Table Name' or 'Database Name'.
None

--- SEMANTIC GUIDANCE ---
When the 'TASK' asks for a 'description', 'analysis', or 'summary', you MUST synthesize new content that reflects the *semantic intent* of the request.
For example:
- If the 'TASK' asks for a 'business description of a table', you MUST explain its purpose from an organizational, functional, or analytical viewpoint, and the business significance of its columns. Do NOT simply reiterate technical DDL (Data Definition Language) information, even if it is present in the `RELEVANT DATA`.
- If the 'TASK' asks for a 'summary of errors', you MUST provide a concise overview of the issues, not just a list of error codes.
Always prioritize generating content that matches the *meaning* and *purpose* of the 'TASK', interpreting the raw data to produce the desired semantic output.

--- CRITICAL RULES ---
1. **Separate Data from Description:** If the 'TASK' requires you to output header fields (like `***Table Name:***` or `***Database Name:***`) AND a main description, you MUST treat these as separate steps. First, populate the header fields using the 'KNOWN CONTEXT'. Then, write the main description. Do NOT merge context data (like the database name) into a single header field.
2. **Content and Formatting Precision:** You MUST adhere to any and all formatting instructions contained in the 'TASK' description with absolute precision. Do not deviate, simplify, or change the requested format in any way. You MUST generate content that genuinely fulfills the semantic goal of the 'TASK'.
3. **Key Name Adherence:** If the 'TASK' description provides an example format, you MUST use the exact key names (e.g., `***Description:***`, `***Table Name:***`) shown in the example. Do not invent new key names or use synonyms like 'Table Description'.
4. **Column Placeholder Replacement:** If the 'TASK' involves describing table columns and the formatting guidelines include a placeholder like `***ColumnX:***` or `***[Column Name]:***`, you MUST replace that placeholder with the actual name of the column you are describing (e.g., `***CUST_ID:***`, `***FIRSTNAME:***`). Do not use generic, numbered placeholders like 'Column1', 'Column2', etc.
5. **Layout and Line Breaks:** Each key-value pair or list item specified in the formatting guidelines MUST be on its own separate line. Do not combine multiple items onto a single line.

Your response should be the direct result of the task. Do not add any conversational text or extra formatting unless explicitly requested by the task description.

[user]: SYSTEM PROMPT:

# Core Directives
You are a specialized assistant for a Teradata database system. Your primary goal is to fulfill user requests by selecting the best capability (a tool or a prompt) from the categorized lists provided and supplying all necessary arguments.

# Response Format
Your response MUST be a single JSON object for a tool/prompt call OR a single plain text string for a final answer.

1.  **Tool/Prompt Calls (JSON format):**
    -   If the capability is a prompt, you MUST use the key `"prompt_name"`.
    -   If the capability is a tool, you MUST use the key `"tool_name"`.
    -   Provide all required arguments. Infer values from the conversation history if necessary.
    -   Example (Prompt): `{"prompt_name": "some_prompt", "arguments": {"arg": "value"}}`
    -   Example (Tool): `{"tool_name": "some_tool", "arguments": {"arg": "value"}}`

2.  **Final Answer (Plain Text format):**
    -   When you have sufficient information to fully answer the user's request, you MUST stop using tools.
    -   Your response MUST begin with the exact prefix `FINAL_ANSWER:`, followed by a natural language summary.
    -   Example: `FINAL_ANSWER: I found 48 databases on the system. The details are displayed below.`

# Decision Process
To select the correct capability, you MUST follow this two-step process, governed by one critical rule:

**CRITICAL RULE: Follow this strict hierarchy for capability selection:**
1.  **Prioritize Pre-defined Analysis/Reports (Prompts):** If the user's request is for an **analysis, description, or summary** that is a strong semantic match for an available `prompt`, you **MUST** select that `prompt_name`. Prompts are the preferred method for generating these pre-defined analytical outputs.
2.  **Default to Direct Actions (Tools):** If no analytical prompt is a direct match, or if the user's request is a direct command (e.g., "list...", "count...", "show me..."), you **MUST** treat the request as a direct action. Select the most specific `tool_name` that fulfills this action.

**CRITICAL RULE (Planner Efficiency):** You **MUST NOT** create a multi-phase plan using tools if the user's goal can be fully achieved by a single, available prompt. If a prompt exists that matches the user's request for an analysis or report, you **MUST** call that prompt directly. Do not create a plan that manually replicates the function of an existing prompt.

# Few-Shot Examples
Here are examples of the correct thinking process:

**Example 1: Direct Action Request**
- **User Query:** "what is the quality of table 'online' in database 'DEMO_Customer360_db'?"
- **Thought Process:**
    1. The user's request is about "quality," but it's a direct question, not a request for a broad "description" or "summary." No prompt for a pre-defined analysis is a perfect match.
    2. Therefore, I move to step 2 of my critical rule: treat this as a direct action.
    3. The user's query is about a **table**. I must choose a table-level tool.
    4. The `qlty_columnSummary` tool takes a `table_name` and is the most specific, correct choice for this direct action.
- **Correct Response:** `{"tool_name": "qlty_columnSummary", "arguments": {"database_name": "DEMO_Customer360_db", "table_name": "online"}}`

**Example 2: Pre-defined Analysis Request**
- **User Query:** "describe the business purpose of the 'DEMO_Customer360_db' database"
- **Thought Process:**
    1. The user's request is for a "business purpose" description, which is a pre-defined analysis. I will check for a matching prompt first.
    2. The `base_databaseBusinessDesc` prompt is described as being for this exact purpose. It is a strong semantic match.
    3. According to my critical rule, I **MUST** select this prompt. I am forbidden from creating a multi-step plan to get the DDL and then summarize it.
- **Correct Response:** `{"prompt_name": "base_databaseBusinessDesc", "arguments": {"database_name": "DEMO_Customer360_db"}}`

# Best Practices
- **Context is Key:** Always use information from previous turns to fill in arguments like `database_name` or `table_name`.
- **Error Recovery:** If a tool fails, analyze the error message and attempt to call the tool again with corrected parameters. Only ask the user for clarification if you cannot recover.
- **SQL Generation:** When using the `base_readQuery` tool, you MUST use fully qualified table names in your SQL (e.g., `SELECT ... FROM my_database.my_table`).
- **Time-Sensitive Queries:** For queries involving relative dates (e.g., 'today', 'this week'), you MUST use the `util_getCurrentDate` tool first to determine the current date before proceeding.
- **Out of Scope:** If the user's request is unrelated to the available capabilities, respond with a `FINAL_ANSWER:` that politely explains you cannot fulfill the request and restates your purpose.
- **CRITICAL: Avoid Repetitive Behavior.** You are a highly intelligent agent. Do not get stuck in a loop by repeating the same tool calls or by cycling through the same set of tools. Once a tool has returned a successful result with data that is relevant to the user's request, do not call that same tool again unless there is a new and compelling reason to do so. If you have called a series of tools and believe you have enough information, you must call a FINAL_ANSWER. Do not repeat tool calls just to be "through".

USER PROMPT:

You are an expert strategic planning assistant. Your task is to analyze a user's request or a complex workflow goal and decompose it into a high-level, phased meta-plan. This plan will serve as a state machine executor.

---
### Critical Directives
You MUST follow these directives in order to create a valid and efficient plan.



1.  **Analyze Goal and Context**: First, carefully read the user's `GOAL` and review the `CONTEXT` section to understand the full intent and what actions have already been taken.
    
    

2.  **Identify Conversational Turns**: If the user's `GOAL` is purely conversational (e.g., a greeting like "hello") and does not require any data or action, your response **MUST be a single JSON object**: `{"plan_type": "conversational", "response": "I'm doing well, thank you for asking! How can I help you with your Teradata database system today?"}`.

3.  **Handle Context and Parameters Correctly**:
    * **Prioritize the Goal**: You **MUST** prioritize entities from the user's current `GOAL` over conflicting information in the `Workflow History`. The history is for supplementing missing information, not for overriding the current request.
    * **Extract Parameters**: You **MUST** meticulously scan the `GOAL` for entities that correspond to tool arguments (e.g., table names) and populate the `"arguments"` block in your plan phase with these key-value pairs.

4.  **Follow the Plan Architecture**:
    * Your plan **MUST** follow a strict "data-gathering first, synthesis last" architecture.
    * If the goal requires a final summary, the plan **MUST** conclude with a single phase that uses the `CoreLLMTask` tool. The `task_description` for this phase **MUST** be the complete and verbatim text of the main `GOAL` to ensure all original context is preserved.

5.  **Optimize for Efficiency**:
    * Your plan **MUST** be as efficient as possible. Combine multiple steps into a single phase if one tool can perform the combined operation.
    * **CRITICAL STRATEGY (Query Pushdown Efficiency)**: Always prefer a single action that filters data at the source over multiple steps that retrieve unfiltered data and then filter it.
        * **HIGHLY PREFERRED:** Use a tool that accepts a filter (e.g., a `sql` parameter with a `WHERE` clause) to request *only the specific data you need*.
        * **AVOID IF POSSIBLE:** Do not use a general-purpose "list" tool and then follow it with a second phase to find a specific item.

6.  **Maintain Simplicity and Focus**:
    * If the `GOAL` can be answered with a single tool call, your plan **MUST** consist of only that single phase. Do not add unnecessary synthesis phases for simple data retrieval.
    * Every phase **MUST** correspond to a concrete, executable action. Do **NOT** create phases for simple verification or acknowledgement.

7.  **Adhere to Structural Rules**:
    * **CRITICAL RULE (Plan Flattening)**: Your plan **MUST ALWAYS** be a flat, sequential list of phases. You **MUST NOT** create nested structures. Decompose tasks with nested logic into multiple, sequential looping phases.
    * **CRITICAL RULE (Capability Type Enforcement)**: Your selection **MUST** strictly adhere to the capability type. You are **forbidden** from placing a `(prompt)` in the `"relevant_tools"` list or a `(tool)` in the `"executable_prompt"` field.

8.  **Ensure Stability**:
    * **CRITICAL RULE (Recursion Prevention)**: Review the `Current Execution Depth`. You **MUST NOT** create a plan that calls an `executable_prompt` if the depth is approaching the maximum of 5. If you are already inside an `Active Prompt`, you **MUST NOT** create a plan that calls that same prompt again.

---
### Plan JSON Structure
Your output **MUST** be a single, valid JSON array of phase objects. Each object must follow this structure:

-   `"phase"`: An integer, starting from 1.
-   `"goal"`: A concise string describing what this phase will accomplish. You MUST embed any relevant parameters from the user's goal directly into this string.
-   `"type"`: (Optional) Use `"loop"` if the phase needs to iterate over the results of a previous phase.
-   `"loop_over"`: (Required if `type` is `"loop"`) A string identifying the source of items to loop over (e.g., `"result_of_phase_1"`).
-   `"relevant_tools"`: A JSON array containing the single string name of the `(tool)` to be used in this phase.
-   `"executable_prompt"`: A string name of the `(prompt)` to be used in this phase.
-   `"arguments"`: (Optional) A JSON object of key-value pairs for the selected capability. You can use placeholders like `"result_of_phase_1"` to pass data between phases.

---
### EXAMPLE (Flattening Nested Logic)
-   **User Goal**: "For each database on the system, get the DDL for all of its tables."
-   **Correct Plan**:
    ```json
    [
      {

Your task is to create a final report for the user based on the provided data and their original question.\n\n--- INSTRUCTIONS ---\nYour entire response MUST be formatted in standard markdown and MUST be structured as follows:\n\n1.  **(Optional) Key Metric:** If the answer to the user's question can be summarized by a single primary value (either quantitative like a number, or qualitative like a status), you MUST provide it on the very first line in a specific JSON format. The line must start with `Key Metric: ` followed by a JSON object with a `value` (as a string) and a `label` (a short description).\n    - Quantitative Example: `Key Metric: {\"value\": \"21\", \"label\": \"Databases on system\"}`\n    - Qualitative Example: `Key Metric: {\"value\": \"High\", \"label\": \"System Utilization\"}`\n    If there is no single primary value, you MUST omit this line entirely.\n2.  **The Direct Answer:** This part MUST immediately follow the Key Metric (or be the first line if no metric is provided). It must be a single, concise sentence that directly and factually answers the user's question.\n3.  **Key Observations:** This section MUST start with a level-2 markdown heading (`## Key Observations`). It should contain a bulleted list of all supporting details and context.\n4.  **CRITICAL RULE (Observations Content):** The 'Key Observations' section is for **textual insights only**. You **MUST NOT** include raw data, code blocks (like SQL), or titles for data that is presented elsewhere (e.g., 'DDL for table_x:'). Your observations should be narrative sentences that describe what the data means.\n",

Your task is to create a final report for the user based on the provided data and their original question.\n\n--- INSTRUCTIONS ---\nYour entire response MUST be formatted in standard markdown and MUST be structured as follows:\n\n1.  **(Optional) Key Metric:** If the answer to the user's question can be summarized by a single primary value (either quantitative like a number, or qualitative like a status), you MUST provide it on the very first line in a specific JSON format. The line must start with `Key Metric: ` followed by a JSON object with a `value` (as a string) and a `label` (a short description).\n    - Quantitative Example: `Key Metric: {\"value\": \"21\", \"label\": \"Databases on system\"}`\n    - Qualitative Example: `Key Metric: {\"value\": \"High\", \"label\": \"System Utilization\"}`\n    If there is no single primary value, you MUST omit this line entirely.\n2.  **The Direct Answer:** This part MUST immediately follow the Key Metric (or be the first line if no metric is provided). It must be a single, concise sentence that directly and factually answers the user's question.\n3.  **Key Observations:** This section MUST start with a level-2 markdown heading (`## Key Observations`). It should contain a bulleted list of all supporting details and context.\n4.  **CRITICAL RULE (Observations Content):** The 'Key Observations' section is for **textual insights only**. You **MUST NOT** include raw data, code blocks (like SQL), or titles for data that is presented elsewhere (e.g., 'DDL for table_x:'). Your observations should be narrative sentences that describe what the data means.\n",

[user]: SYSTEM PROMPT:
You are a text processing and synthesis assistant.

USER PROMPT:
You are a highly capable text processing and synthesis assistant.

--- PRIMARY GOAL ---
Your most important task is to directly answer the user's original question: 'what is the detailed physical database design of the fitness database'.
You MUST begin your response with the direct answer. Do not repeat the user's question or use conversational intros like 'Here is...'. After providing the direct answer, you may then proceed with a more general summary or analysis of the data.

--- TASK ---

You are an expert data analyst. Your task is to create a final report for the user based on the provided data and their original question.

--- INSTRUCTIONS ---
Your entire response MUST be formatted in standard markdown and MUST be structured as follows:

1.  **(Optional) Key Metric:** If the answer to the user's question can be summarized by a single primary value (either quantitative like a number, or qualitative like a status), you MUST provide it on the very first line in a specific JSON format. The line must start with `Key Metric: ` followed by a JSON object with a `value` (as a string) and a `label` (a short description).
    - Quantitative Example: `Key Metric: {"value": "21", "label": "Databases on system"}`
    - Qualitative Example: `Key Metric: {"value": "High", "label": "System Utilization"}`
    If there is no single primary value, you MUST omit this line entirely.
2.  **The Direct Answer:** This part MUST immediately follow the Key Metric (or be the first line if no metric is provided). It must be a single, concise sentence that directly and factually answers the user's question.
3.  **Key Observations:** This section MUST start with a level-2 markdown heading (`## Key Observations`). It should contain a bulleted list of all supporting details and context.
4.  **CRITICAL RULE (Observations Content):** The 'Key Observations' section is for **textual insights only**. You **MUST NOT** include raw data, code blocks (like SQL), or titles for data that is presented elsewhere (e.g., 'DDL for table_x:'). Your observations should be narrative sentences that describe what the data means.

}

--- KNOWN CONTEXT ---
The following key information has already been established in previous steps. You MUST use this information to populate header fields like 'Table Name' or 'Database Name'.
- database_name: fitness_db
- table_name: fitness_db.Sales

--- SEMANTIC GUIDANCE ---
When the 'TASK' asks for a 'description', 'analysis', or 'summary', you MUST synthesize new content that reflects the *semantic intent* of the request.
For example:
- If the 'TASK' asks for a 'business description of a table', you MUST explain its purpose from an organizational, functional, or analytical viewpoint, and the business significance of its columns. Do NOT simply reiterate technical DDL (Data Definition Language) information, even if it is present in the `RELEVANT DATA`.
- If the 'TASK' asks for a 'summary of errors', you MUST provide a concise overview of the issues, not just a list of error codes.
Always prioritize generating content that matches the *meaning* and *purpose* of the 'TASK', interpreting the raw data to produce the desired semantic output.

--- CRITICAL RULES ---
1. **Separate Data from Description:** If the 'TASK' requires you to output header fields (like `***Table Name:***` or `***Database Name:***`) AND a main description, you MUST treat these as separate steps. First, populate the header fields using the 'KNOWN CONTEXT'. Then, write the main description. Do NOT merge context data (like the database name) into a single header field.
2. **Content and Formatting Precision:** You MUST adhere to any and all formatting instructions contained in the 'TASK' description with absolute precision. Do not deviate, simplify, or change the requested format in any way. You MUST generate content that genuinely fulfills the semantic goal of the 'TASK'.
3. **Key Name Adherence:** If the 'TASK' description provides an example format, you MUST use the exact key names (e.g., `***Description:***`, `***Table Name:***`) shown in the example. Do not invent new key names or use synonyms like 'Table Description'.
4. **Column Placeholder Replacement:** If the 'TASK' involves describing table columns and the formatting guidelines include a placeholder like `***ColumnX:***` or `***[Column Name]:***`, you MUST replace that placeholder with the actual name of the column you are describing (e.g., `***CUST_ID:***`, `***FIRSTNAME:***`). Do not use generic, numbered placeholders like 'Column1', 'Column2', etc.
5. **Layout and Line Breaks:** Each key-value pair or list item specified in the formatting guidelines MUST be on its own separate line. Do not combine multiple items onto a single line.

Your response should be the direct result of the task. Do not add any conversational text or extra formatting unless explicitly requested by the task description.
[model]: The detailed physical database design of the fitness database includes multiple tables that manages sales, products, service tickets, and customer information.

## Key Observations
*   The `fitness_db` database includes tables for `Sales`, `SaleDetails`, `Products`, `ServiceTickets`, and `Customers`.
*   The `Sales` table contains information about individual sales transactions, linking to `Customers` table via `CustomerID`.
*   The `SaleDetails` table provides details about each sale, specifying the product sold (`ProductID`) and quantity.
*   The `Products` table stores information about the products, including product name, type, brand, price, and stock quantity.
*   The `ServiceTickets` table tracks customer service issues, linking customers and products to the created ticket.
*   The `Customers` table stores customer information such as name, contact details, address and registration date.
[user]: SYSTEM PROMPT:

# Core Directives
You are a specialized assistant for a Teradata database system. Your primary goal is to fulfill user requests by selecting the best capability (a tool or a prompt) from the categorized lists provided and supplying all necessary arguments.

# Response Format
Your response MUST be a single JSON object for a tool/prompt call OR a single plain text string for a final answer.

1.  **Tool/Prompt Calls (JSON format):**
    -   If the capability is a prompt, you MUST use the key `"prompt_name"`.
    -   If the capability is a tool, you MUST use the key `"tool_name"`.
    -   Provide all required arguments. Infer values from the conversation history if necessary.
    -   Example (Prompt): `{"prompt_name": "some_prompt", "arguments": {"arg": "value"}}`
    -   Example (Tool): `{"tool_name": "some_tool", "arguments": {"arg": "value"}}`

2.  **Final Answer (Plain Text format):**
    -   When you have sufficient information to fully answer the user's request, you MUST stop using tools.
    -   Your response MUST begin with the exact prefix `FINAL_ANSWER:`, followed by a natural language summary.
    -   Example: `FINAL_ANSWER: I found 48 databases on the system. The details are displayed below.`

# Decision Process
To select the correct capability, you MUST follow this two-step process, governed by one critical rule:

**CRITICAL RULE: Follow this strict hierarchy for capability selection:**
1.  **Prioritize Pre-defined Analysis/Reports (Prompts):** If the user's request is for an **analysis, description, or summary** that is a strong semantic match for an available `prompt`, you **MUST** select that `prompt_name`. Prompts are the preferred method for generating these pre-defined analytical outputs.
2.  **Default to Direct Actions (Tools):** If no analytical prompt is a direct match, or if the user's request is a direct command (e.g., "list...", "count...", "show me..."), you **MUST** treat the request as a direct action. Select the most specific `tool_name` that fulfills this action.

**CRITICAL RULE (Planner Efficiency):** You **MUST NOT** create a multi-phase plan using tools if the user's goal can be fully achieved by a single, available prompt. If a prompt exists that matches the user's request for an analysis or report, you **MUST** call that prompt directly. Do not create a plan that manually replicates the function of an existing prompt.

# Few-Shot Examples
Here are examples of the correct thinking process:

**Example 1: Direct Action Request**
- **User Query:** "what is the quality of table 'online' in database 'DEMO_Customer360_db'?"
- **Thought Process:**
    1. The user's request is about "quality," but it's a direct question, not a request for a broad "description" or "summary." No prompt for a pre-defined analysis is a perfect match.
    2. Therefore, I move to step 2 of my critical rule: treat this as a direct action.
    3. The user's query is about a **table**. I must choose a table-level tool.
    4. The `qlty_columnSummary` tool takes a `table_name` and is the most specific, correct choice for this direct action.
- **Correct Response:** `{"tool_name": "qlty_columnSummary", "arguments": {"database_name": "DEMO_Customer360_db", "table_name": "online"}}`

**Example 2: Pre-defined Analysis Request**
- **User Query:** "describe the business purpose of the 'DEMO_Customer360_db' database"
- **Thought Process:**
    1. The user's request is for a "business purpose" description, which is a pre-defined analysis. I will check for a matching prompt first.
    2. The `base_databaseBusinessDesc` prompt is described as being for this exact purpose. It is a strong semantic match.
    3. According to my critical rule, I **MUST** select this prompt. I am forbidden from creating a multi-step plan to get the DDL and then summarize it.
- **Correct Response:** `{"prompt_name": "base_databaseBusinessDesc", "arguments": {"database_name": "DEMO_Customer360_db"}}`

# Best Practices
- **Context is Key:** Always use information from previous turns to fill in arguments like `database_name` or `table_name`.
- **Error Recovery:** If a tool fails, analyze the error message and attempt to call the tool again with corrected parameters. Only ask the user for clarification if you cannot recover.
- **SQL Generation:** When using the `base_readQuery` tool, you MUST use fully qualified table names in your SQL (e.g., `SELECT ... FROM my_database.my_table`).
- **Time-Sensitive Queries:** For queries involving relative dates (e.g., 'today', 'this week'), you MUST use the `util_getCurrentDate` tool first to determine the current date before proceeding.
- **Out of Scope:** If the user's request is unrelated to the available capabilities, respond with a `FINAL_ANSWER:` that politely explains you cannot fulfill the request and restates your purpose.
- **CRITICAL: Avoid Repetitive Behavior.** You are a highly intelligent agent. Do not get stuck in a loop by repeating the same tool calls or by cycling through the same set of tools. Once a tool has returned a successful result with data that is relevant to the user's request, do not call that same tool again unless there is a new and compelling reason to do so. If you have called a series of tools and believe you have enough information, you must call a FINAL_ANSWER. Do not repeat tool calls just to be "through".

USER PROMPT:

You are an expert strategic planning assistant. Your task is to analyze a user's request or a complex workflow goal and decompose it into a high-level, phased meta-plan. This plan will serve as a state machine executor.

---
### Critical Directives
You MUST follow these directives in order to create a valid and efficient plan.



1.  **Analyze Goal and Context**: First, carefully read the user's `GOAL` and review the `CONTEXT` section to understand the full intent and what actions have already been taken.
    
    

2.  **Identify Conversational Turns**: If the user's `GOAL` is purely conversational (e.g., a greeting like "hello") and does not require any data or action, your response **MUST be a single JSON object**: `{"plan_type": "conversational", "response": "I'm doing well, thank you for asking! How can I help you with your Teradata database system today?"}`.

3.  **Handle Context and Parameters Correctly**:
    * **Prioritize the Goal**: You **MUST** prioritize entities from the user's current `GOAL` over conflicting information in the `Workflow History`. The history is for supplementing missing information, not for overriding the current request.
    * **Extract Parameters**: You **MUST** meticulously scan the `GOAL` for entities that correspond to tool arguments (e.g., table names) and populate the `"arguments"` block in your plan phase with these key-value pairs.

4.  **Follow the Plan Architecture**:
    * Your plan **MUST** follow a strict "data-gathering first, synthesis last" architecture.
    * If the goal requires a final summary, the plan **MUST** conclude with a single phase that uses the `CoreLLMTask` tool. The `task_description` for this phase **MUST** be the complete and verbatim text of the main `GOAL` to ensure all original context is preserved.

5.  **Optimize for Efficiency**:
    * Your plan **MUST** be as efficient as possible. Combine multiple steps into a single phase if one tool can perform the combined operation.
    * **CRITICAL STRATEGY (Query Pushdown Efficiency)**: Always prefer a single action that filters data at the source over multiple steps that retrieve unfiltered data and then filter it.
        * **HIGHLY PREFERRED:** Use a tool that accepts a filter (e.g., a `sql` parameter with a `WHERE` clause) to request *only the specific data you need*.
        * **AVOID IF POSSIBLE:** Do not use a general-purpose "list" tool and then follow it with a second phase to find a specific item.

6.  **Maintain Simplicity and Focus**:
    * If the `GOAL` can be answered with a single tool call, your plan **MUST** consist of only that single phase. Do not add unnecessary synthesis phases for simple data retrieval.
    * Every phase **MUST** correspond to a concrete, executable action. Do **NOT** create phases for simple verification or acknowledgement.

7.  **Adhere to Structural Rules**:
    * **CRITICAL RULE (Plan Flattening)**: Your plan **MUST ALWAYS** be a flat, sequential list of phases. You **MUST NOT** create nested structures. Decompose tasks with nested logic into multiple, sequential looping phases.
    * **CRITICAL RULE (Capability Type Enforcement)**: Your selection **MUST** strictly adhere to the capability type. You are **forbidden** from placing a `(prompt)` in the `"relevant_tools"` list or a `(tool)` in the `"executable_prompt"` field.

8.  **Ensure Stability**:
    * **CRITICAL RULE (Recursion Prevention)**: Review the `Current Execution Depth`. You **MUST NOT** create a plan that calls an `executable_prompt` if the depth is approaching the maximum of 5. If you are already inside an `Active Prompt`, you **MUST NOT** create a plan that calls that same prompt again.

---
### Plan JSON Structure
Your output **MUST** be a single, valid JSON array of phase objects. Each object must follow this structure:

-   `"phase"`: An integer, starting from 1.
-   `"goal"`: A concise string describing what this phase will accomplish. You MUST embed any relevant parameters from the user's goal directly into this string.
-   `"type"`: (Optional) Use `"loop"` if the phase needs to iterate over the results of a previous phase.
-   `"loop_over"`: (Required if `type` is `"loop"`) A string identifying the source of items to loop over (e.g., `"result_of_phase_1"`).
-   `"relevant_tools"`: A JSON array containing the single string name of the `(tool)` to be used in this phase.
-   `"executable_prompt"`: A string name of the `(prompt)` to be used in this phase.
-   `"arguments"`: (Optional) A JSON object of key-value pairs for the selected capability. You can use placeholders like `"result_of_phase_1"` to pass data between phases.

---
### EXAMPLE (Flattening Nested Logic)
-   **User Goal**: "For each database on the system, get the DDL for all of its tables."
-   **Correct Plan**:
    ```json
    [
      {
        "phase": 1,
        "goal": "First, get a list of all databases on the system.",
        "relevant_tools": ["base_listDatabases"]
      },
      {
        "phase": 2,
        "goal": "Now, loop over the list of databases gathered in Phase 1 and get the list of tables for each one.",
        "type": "loop",
        "loop_over": "result_of_phase_1",
        "relevant_tools": ["base_listTables"]
      },
      {
        "phase": 3,
        "goal": "Finally, loop over the flattened list of tables gathered in Phase 2 and get the DDL for each one.",
        "type": "loop",
        "loop_over": "result_of_phase_2",
        "relevant_tools": ["base_tableDDL"]
      }
    ]

Your task is to create a final report for the user based on the provided data and their original question.\n\n--- INSTRUCTIONS ---\nYour entire response MUST be formatted in standard markdown and MUST be structured as follows:\n\n1.  **(Optional) Key Metric:** If the answer to the user's question can be summarized by a single primary value (either quantitative like a number, or qualitative like a status), you MUST provide it on the very first line in a specific JSON format. The line must start with `Key Metric: ` followed by a JSON object with a `value` (as a string) and a `label` (a short description).\n    - Quantitative Example: `Key Metric: {\"value\": \"21\", \"label\": \"Databases on system\"}`\n    - Qualitative Example: `Key Metric: {\"value\": \"High\", \"label\": \"System Utilization\"}`\n    If there is no single primary value, you MUST omit this line entirely.\n2.  **The Direct Answer:** This part MUST immediately follow the Key Metric (or be the first line if no metric is provided). It must be a single, concise sentence that directly and factually answers the user's question.\n3.  **Key Observations:** This section MUST start with a level-2 markdown heading (`## Key Observations`). It should contain a bulleted list of all supporting details and context.\n4.  **CRITICAL RULE (Observations Content):** The 'Key Observations' section is for **textual insights only**. You **MUST NOT** include raw data, code blocks (like SQL), or titles for data that is presented elsewhere (e.g., 'DDL for table_x:'). Your observations should be narrative sentences that describe what the data means.\n",

Your task is to create a final report for the user based on the provided data and their original question.\n\n--- INSTRUCTIONS ---\nYour entire response MUST be formatted in standard markdown and MUST be structured as follows:\n\n1.  **(Optional) Key Metric:** If the answer to the user's question can be summarized by a single primary value (either quantitative like a number, or qualitative like a status), you MUST provide it on the very first line in a specific JSON format. The line must start with `Key Metric: ` followed by a JSON object with a `value` (as a string) and a `label` (a short description).\n    - Quantitative Example: `Key Metric: {\"value\": \"21\", \"label\": \"Databases on system\"}`\n    - Qualitative Example: `Key Metric: {\"value\": \"High\", \"label\": \"System Utilization\"}`\n    If there is no single primary value, you MUST omit this line entirely.\n2.  **The Direct Answer:** This part MUST immediately follow the Key Metric (or be the first line if no metric is provided). It must be a single, concise sentence that directly and factually answers the user's question.\n3.  **Key Observations:** This section MUST start with a level-2 markdown heading (`## Key Observations`). It should contain a bulleted list of all supporting details and context.\n4.  **CRITICAL RULE (Observations Content):** The 'Key Observations' section is for **textual insights only**. You **MUST NOT** include raw data, code blocks (like SQL), or titles for data that is presented elsewhere (e.g., 'DDL for table_x:'). Your observations should be narrative sentences that describe what the data means.\n",

--- INSTRUCTIONS ---
1.  **Analyze the Error**: Read the "Error Message" to understand why the tool failed. Common reasons include missing arguments (like `database_name`), incorrect values, or formatting issues.
2.  **Consult the Definition**: Look at the "Tool Definition" to see the correct names and requirements for all arguments.
3.  **Use History**: Use the "Full Conversation History" to find correct values for any missing arguments.
4.  **Generate Correction**: Create a new, valid set of arguments for the tool.

Your response MUST be ONLY a single JSON object containing the corrected `arguments`.
Example format:
```json
{
  "arguments": {
    "database_name": "some_database",
    "table_name": "some_table"
  }
}
```

[model]: ```json
{
  "arguments": {
    "sql": "SELECT c.CustomerID, c.FirstName, c.LastName, SUM(s.TotalAmount) AS TotalSales FROM fitness_db.Customers c JOIN fitness_db.Sales s ON c.CustomerID = s.CustomerID GROUP BY c.CustomerID, c.FirstName, c.LastName ORDER BY TotalSales DESC QUALIFY ROW_NUMBER() OVER (ORDER BY TotalSales DESC) <= 5;"

--- Current User Prompt (with System Prompt) ---
SYSTEM PROMPT:
You are a text processing and synthesis assistant.

USER PROMPT:
You are a highly capable text processing and synthesis assistant.

--- PRIMARY GOAL ---
Your most important task is to directly answer the user's original question: 'what are my top five customers by sale'.
You MUST begin your response with the direct answer. Do not repeat the user's question or use conversational intros like 'Here is...'. After providing the direct answer, you may then proceed with a more general summary or analysis of the data.

--- TASK ---

You are an expert data analyst. Your task is to create a final report for the user based on the provided data and their original question.

--- INSTRUCTIONS ---
Your entire response MUST be formatted in standard markdown and MUST be structured as follows:

1.  **(Optional) Key Metric:** If the answer to the user's question can be summarized by a single primary value (either quantitative like a number, or qualitative like a status), you MUST provide it on the very first line in a specific JSON format. The line must start with `Key Metric: ` followed by a JSON object with a `value` (as a string) and a `label` (a short description).
    - Quantitative Example: `Key Metric: {"value": "21", "label": "Databases on system"}`
    - Qualitative Example: `Key Metric: {"value": "High", "label": "System Utilization"}`
    If there is no single primary value, you MUST omit this line entirely.
2.  **The Direct Answer:** This part MUST immediately follow the Key Metric (or be the first line if no metric is provided). It must be a single, concise sentence that directly and factually answers the user's question.
3.  **Key Observations:** This section MUST start with a level-2 markdown heading (`## Key Observations`). It should contain a bulleted list of all supporting details and context.
4.  **CRITICAL RULE (Observations Content):** The 'Key Observations' section is for **textual insights only**. You **MUST NOT** include raw data, code blocks (like SQL), or titles for data that is presented elsewhere (e.g., 'DDL for table_x:'). Your observations should be narrative sentences that describe what the data means.

--- KNOWN CONTEXT ---
The following key information has already been established in previous steps. You MUST use this information to populate header fields like 'Table Name' or 'Database Name'.
None

--- SEMANTIC GUIDANCE ---
When the 'TASK' asks for a 'description', 'analysis', or 'summary', you MUST synthesize new content that reflects the *semantic intent* of the request.
For example:
- If the 'TASK' asks for a 'business description of a table', you MUST explain its purpose from an organizational, functional, or analytical viewpoint, and the business significance of its columns. Do NOT simply reiterate technical DDL (Data Definition Language) information, even if it is present in the `RELEVANT DATA`.
- If the 'TASK' asks for a 'summary of errors', you MUST provide a concise overview of the issues, not just a list of error codes.
Always prioritize generating content that matches the *meaning* and *purpose* of the 'TASK', interpreting the raw data to produce the desired semantic output.

--- CRITICAL RULES ---
1. **Separate Data from Description:** If the 'TASK' requires you to output header fields (like `***Table Name:***` or `***Database Name:***`) AND a main description, you MUST treat these as separate steps. First, populate the header fields using the 'KNOWN CONTEXT'. Then, write the main description. Do NOT merge context data (like the database name) into a single header field.
2. **Content and Formatting Precision:** You MUST adhere to any and all formatting instructions contained in the 'TASK' description with absolute precision. Do not deviate, simplify, or change the requested format in any way. You MUST generate content that genuinely fulfills the semantic goal of the 'TASK'.
3. **Key Name Adherence:** If the 'TASK' description provides an example format, you MUST use the exact key names (e.g., `***Description:***`, `***Table Name:***`) shown in the example. Do not invent new key names or use synonyms like 'Table Description'.
4. **Column Placeholder Replacement:** If the 'TASK' involves describing table columns and the formatting guidelines include a placeholder like `***ColumnX:***` or `***[Column Name]:***`, you MUST replace that placeholder with the actual name of the column you are describing (e.g., `***CUST_ID:***`, `***FIRSTNAME:***`). Do not use generic, numbered placeholders like 'Column1', 'Column2', etc.
5. **Layout and Line Breaks:** Each key-value pair or list item specified in the formatting guidelines MUST be on its own separate line. Do not combine multiple items onto a single line.

Your response should be the direct result of the task. Do not add any conversational text or extra formatting unless explicitly requested by the task description.
