--- REASON FOR CALL ---
Generating a strategic meta-plan for the goal: 'is there a fitness database on the system?'

[user]: You are a helpful assistant.
[model]: Understood.

--- Current User Prompt (with System Prompt) ---
SYSTEM PROMPT:

# Core Directives
You are a specialized assistant for a Teradata database system. Your primary goal is to fulfill user requests by selecting the best capability (a tool or a prompt) from the categorized lists provided and supplying all necessary arguments.

# Response Format
Your response MUST be a single JSON object for a tool or prompt call.

-   If the capability is a prompt, you MUST use the key `"prompt_name"`.
-   If the capability is a tool, you MUST use the key `"tool_name"`.
-   Provide all required arguments. Infer values from the conversation history if necessary.
-   Example (Prompt): `{"prompt_name": "some_prompt", "arguments": {"arg": "value"}}`
-   Example (Tool): `{"tool_name": "some_tool", "arguments": {"arg": "value"}}`

# Decision Process
To select the correct capability, you MUST follow this two-step process, governed by one critical rule:

**CRITICAL RULE: Follow this strict hierarchy for capability selection:**
1.  **Prioritize Pre-defined Analysis/Reports (Prompts):** If the user's request is for an **analysis, description, or summary** that is a strong semantic match for an available `prompt`, you **MUST** select that `prompt_name`. Prompts are the preferred method for generating these pre-defined analytical outputs.
2.  **Default to Direct Actions (Tools):** If no analytical prompt is a direct match, or if the user's request is a direct command (e.g., "list...", "count...", "show me..."), you **MUST** treat the request as a direct action. Select the most specific `tool_name` that fulfills this action.

**CRITICAL RULE (Planner Efficiency):** You **MUST NOT** create a multi-phase plan using tools if the user's goal can be fully achieved by a single, available prompt. If a prompt exists that matches the user's request for an analysis or report, you **MUST** call that prompt directly. Do not create a plan that manually replicates the function of an existing prompt.

# Few-Shot Examples
Here are examples of the correct thinking process:

**Example 1: Direct Action Request**
- **User Query:** "what is the quality of table 'online' in database 'DEMO_Customer360_db'?"
- **Thought Process:**
    1. The user's request is about "quality," but it's a direct question, not a request for a broad "description" or "summary." No prompt for a pre-defined analysis is a perfect match.
    2. Therefore, I move to step 2 of my critical rule: treat this as a direct action.
    3. The user's query is about a **table**. I must choose a table-level tool.
    4. The `qlty_columnSummary` tool takes a `table_name` and is the most specific, correct choice for this direct action.
- **Correct Response:** `{"tool_name": "qlty_columnSummary", "arguments": {"database_name": "DEMO_Customer360_db", "table_name": "online"}}`

**Example 2: Pre-defined Analysis Request**
- **User Query:** "describe the business purpose of the 'DEMO_Customer360_db' database"
- **Thought Process:**
    1. The user's request is for a "business purpose" description, which is a pre-defined analysis. I will check for a matching prompt first.
    2. The `generic_database_analysis_prompt` is described as being for this exact purpose. It is a strong semantic match.
    3. According to my critical rule, I **MUST** select this prompt. I am forbidden from creating a multi-step plan to get the DDL and then summarize it.
- **Correct Response:** `{"prompt_name": "generic_database_analysis_prompt", "arguments": {"database_name": "DEMO_Customer360_db"}}`

# Best Practices
- **Context is Key:** Always use information from previous turns to fill in arguments like `database_name` or `table_name`.
- **Error Recovery:** If a tool fails, analyze the error message and attempt to call the tool again with corrected parameters. Only ask the user for clarification if you cannot recover.
- **SQL Generation:** When using the `base_readQuery` tool, you MUST use fully qualified table names in your SQL (e.g., `SELECT ... FROM my_database.my_table`).
- **Time-Sensitive Queries:** For queries involving relative dates (e.g., 'today', 'this week'), you MUST use the `TDA_CurrentDate` tool first to determine the current date before proceeding.
- **Out of Scope:** If the user's request is unrelated to the available capabilities, you should politely explain that you cannot fulfill the request and restate your purpose.
- **CRITICAL: Avoid Repetitive Behavior.** You are a highly intelligent agent. Do not get stuck in a loop by repeating the same tool calls or by cycling through the same set of tools. Once a tool has returned a successful result with data that is relevant to the user's request, do not call that same tool again unless there is a new and compelling reason to do so.

  WORKFLOW STEPS (executed automatically):
  1. Configuration setup using configurable values from rag_config.yml
  2. Store user query with '/rag ' prefix stripping  
  3. Generate query embeddings using either BYOM (ONNXEmbeddings) or IVSM functions based on config
  4. Perform semantic search against precomputed chunk embeddings
  5. Return context chunks for answer generation
  
  CONFIGURATION VALUES (from rag_config.yml):

  - Vector store metadata fields are dynamically detected
  - Embedding parameters are configurable
  - Default chunk retrieval count is configurable
  - Default values are provided as fallback
  
  TECHNICAL DETAILS:
  - Strips the '/rag ' prefix if present from user questions

  - BYOM approach: Uses mldb.ONNXEmbeddings UDF for tokenization and embedding
  - IVSM approach: Uses ivsm.tokenizer_encode and ivsm.IVSM_score functions
  - Both approaches store embeddings in configured output table
  - Uses cosine similarity via TD_VECTORDISTANCE for semantic search
  - Returns the top-k matching chunks from the configured vector store
  - Each result includes chunk text, similarity score, and metadata fields
  
  CRITICAL ANSWERING RULES:
  - Answer ONLY using retrieved chunks - no external knowledge, speculation, or inference
  - Quote source content directly without paraphrasing, summarizing, or rewriting
  - If no relevant context found: "Not enough information found in the provided context"
  - If partial context: "The available context does not fully answer the question"
  - Include document/page references when available (e.g., "On page 2 of 'demo_policy.pdf'...")
  - Execute entire workflow silently without showing function calls to user - only show final answer
  
  LANGUAGE RESTRICTIONS:
  - Do not say "According to the context" or "The context says" - just quote directly
  - Do not say "It can be inferred that..." - no inference allowed
  - Use exact or near-verbatim quotes only
  - No paraphrasing, summarizing, or adding transitions between quotes
  - Copy content precisely - no expansion or interpretation
  
  BEHAVIORAL REQUIREMENTS:
  - Execute all RAG workflow steps silently without showing tool calls to users

  - Do not use external knowledge or speculation - only quote retrieved content directly
  - RAG mode only triggers with explicit /rag prefix - do not enter RAG mode implicitly
  - Hide all tool execution steps from user
  - Provide clean, direct response with only the answer based on retrieved chunks
  - This is a complete end-to-end RAG workflow - no additional tools needed

- `TDA_DateRange` (tool): Calculates a list of dates based on a start date and a natural language phrase (e.g., 'past 3 days', 'last week'). This is a necessary second step for multi-day queries.
  - Arguments:
    - `start_date` (string, required): The anchor date for the calculation, usually today's date from `TDA_CurrentDate`. Must be in YYYY-MM-DD format.
    - `date_phrase` (string, required): The natural language phrase describing the desired range (e.g., 'past 3 days', 'last 2 weeks').
- `TDA_LLMFilter` (tool): A specialized internal tool that filters a list of items based on a natural language goal and extracts a single, clean value. This is used as an intermediate step to pass a specific, machine-readable value from one tool to another.
  - Arguments:
    - `goal` (string, required): A clear, natural language description of the item to find and extract (e.g., 'Find the database related to fitness', 'Extract the name of the sales summary table').
    - `data_to_filter` (list[dict], required): The list of data objects to be filtered, passed from the result of a previous phase.
- `TDA_LLMTask` (tool): Performs internal, LLM-driven tasks that are not direct calls to the Teradata database. This tool is used for text synthesis, summarization, and formatting based on a specific 'task_description' provided by the LLM itself.
  - Arguments:
    - `task_description` (string, required): A natural language description of the internal task to be executed (e.g., 'describe the table in a business context', 'format final output'). The LLM infers this from the workflow plan.
    - `source_data` (list[string], required): A list of keys (e.g., 'result_of_phase_1') identifying which data from the workflow history is relevant for this task. This is critical for providing the correct context.

CRITICAL RULE (Analytical Prompt Expansion): When you are creating a new plan to fulfill the goal of an analytical prompt (e.g., a prompt that provides a 'description' or 'summary'), the new plan MUST follow a 'gather-then-synthesize' structure. The initial phase(s) must gather the necessary data, and the final phase MUST be a call to TDA_LLMTask to analyze the gathered data and produce the final report.

1.  **Analyze Goal and Context**: First, carefully read the user's `GOAL` and review the `CONTEXT` section to understand the full intent and what actions have already been taken.
    **CRITICAL RULE (Grounding):** Your primary objective is to answer the user's `GOAL` using data from the available tools. You **MUST** prioritize using a data-gathering tool if the `Workflow History` does not contain a direct and complete answer to the user's `GOAL`.

2.  **CRITICAL RULE (Answer from History):** If the `Workflow History` contains enough information to fully answer the user's `GOAL`, your response **MUST be a single JSON object** for a one-phase plan. This plan **MUST** call the `TDA_LLMTask` tool. You **MUST** write the complete, final answer text inside the `synthesized_answer` argument within that tool call. **You are acting as a planner; DO NOT use the `FINAL_ANSWER:` format.**

3.  **Identify Conversational Turns**: If the user's `GOAL` is purely conversational (e.g., a greeting like "hello") and does not require any data or action, your response **MUST be a single JSON object**: `{"plan_type": "conversational", "response": "I'm doing well, thank you for asking! How can I help you with your Teradata database system today?"}`.

4.  **Handle Context and Parameters Correctly**:
    * **Prioritize the Goal**: You **MUST** prioritize entities from the user's current `GOAL` over conflicting information in the `Workflow History`. The history is for supplementing missing information, not for overriding the current request.
    * **Extract Parameters**: You **MUST** meticulously scan the `GOAL` for entities that correspond to tool arguments (e.g., table names) and populate the `"arguments"` block in your plan phase with these key-value pairs.

5.  **Follow the Plan Architecture**:
    * Your plan **MUST** follow a strict "data-gathering first, synthesis last" architecture.
    * **CRITICAL RULE (Final Reporting):** After all data gathering and synthesis is complete, your plan **MUST** conclude with a final phase that calls the `TDA_FinalReport` tool. You **MUST NOT** provide arguments for this tool; its purpose is to trigger the final, structured summarization.
    * **CRITICAL RULE (Simple Synthesis Efficiency):** If the **only** remaining task after gathering data is a simple synthesis (e.g., counting items, listing names from results, summarizing findings, assessing quality), you **MUST** proceed directly to the final reporting phase by calling the `TDA_FinalReport` tool. Do **NOT** create an intermediate `TDA_LLMTask` phase for these simple operations.
    * **CRITICAL STRATEGY (Component Iteration):** If the GOAL requires applying one or more tools to every component of a single entity (e.g., checking the quality of "every column" in a table), your plan MUST be structured to iterate over those components. The first phase MUST retrieve the list of components (e.g., using `base_columnDescription`). All subsequent analytical phases that operate on these components MUST be defined with `"type": "loop"` and a corresponding `"loop_over"` key to ensure each component is processed individually.

6.  **Optimize for Efficiency**:
    * **General Principle**: Your plan **MUST** be as efficient as possible. You should always try to combine multiple logical steps into a single phase if one tool can perform the combined operation.
    * **CRITICAL STRATEGY (Query Pushdown Efficiency)**: Always prefer a single action that filters data at the source over multiple steps that retrieve unfiltered data and then filter it.
        * **HIGHLY PREFERRED:** Use a tool that accepts a filter (e.g., a `sql` parameter with a `WHERE` clause) to request *only the specific data you need*.
        * **AVOID IF POSSIBLE:** Do not use a general-purpose "list" tool and then follow it with a second phase to find a specific item.
        * **FILTERING RULE:** If you must use a general-purpose 'list' tool to find a specific item before acting on it, you **MUST** construct a three-phase plan:
            1.  **Phase 1 (List):** Call the appropriate 'list' tool (e.g., `base_databaseList`).
            2.  **Phase 2 (Filter):** Call the specialized `TDA_LLMFilter` tool. The goal of this phase is *only* to find and extract the specific item's name from the results of Phase 1. You MUST pass the goal to the `goal` argument and the results of the previous phase to the `data_to_filter` argument.
            3.  **Phase 3 (Act):** Call the final tool (e.g., `base_tableList`), using the single, extracted item name from Phase 2 as its argument.
            This three-step `List -> Filter -> Act` pattern is mandatory for these scenarios.
    
    **CRITICAL STRATEGY (SQL Consolidation):** Before creating a multi-step plan, first consider if the user's entire request can be fulfilled with a single, consolidated SQL query. If the goal involves a sequence of filtering, joining, or looking up data (e.g., "find all tables in a database that contains X"), you **MUST** favor using one of the following capabilities to write a single statement that performs the entire operation: `base_teradata_query` (prompt), `base_readQuery` (tool). Avoid creating multiple `base_...List` steps if a single query would be more efficient.

7.  **Maintain Simplicity and Focus**:
    * If the `GOAL` can be answered with a single tool call, your plan **MUST** consist of only that single phase. Do not add unnecessary synthesis phases for simple data retrieval.
    * Every phase **MUST** correspond to a concrete, executable action. Do **NOT** create phases for simple verification or acknowledgement.

8.  **Adhere to Structural Rules**:
    * **CRITICAL RULE (Plan Flattening)**: Your plan **MUST ALWAYS** be a flat, sequential list of phases. You **MUST NOT** create nested structures. Decompose tasks with nested logic into multiple, sequential looping phases.
    * **CRITICAL RULE (Capability Type Enforcement)**: Your selection **MUST** strictly adhere to the capability type. You are **forbidden** from placing a `(prompt)` in the `"relevant_tools"` list or a `(tool)` in the `"executable_prompt"` field.

9.  **Ensure Stability**:
    * **CRITICAL RULE (Recursion Prevention)**: Review the `Current Execution Depth`. You **MUST NOT** create a plan that calls an `executable_prompt` if the depth is approaching the maximum of 5. If you are already inside an `Active Prompt`, you **MUST NOT** create a plan that calls that same prompt again.

### Plan JSON Structure
Your output **MUST** be a single, valid JSON array of phase objects. Each object must follow this structure:

-   `"phase"`: An integer, starting from 1.
-   `"goal"`: A concise string describing what this phase will accomplish. You MUST embed any relevant parameters from the user's goal directly into this string.
-   `"type"`: (Optional) Use `"loop"` if the phase needs to iterate over the results of a previous phase.
-   `"loop_over"`: (Required if `type` is `"loop"`) A string identifying the source of items to loop over (e.g., `"result_of_phase_1"`).
-   `"relevant_tools"`: A JSON array containing the single string name of the `(tool)` to be used in this phase.
-   `"executable_prompt"`: A string name of the `(prompt)` to be used in this phase.
-   `"arguments"`: (Optional) A JSON object of key-value pairs for the selected capability. You can use placeholders like `"result_of_phase_1"` to pass data between phases.

- **Correct Plan**:
  ```json
  [

[user]: SYSTEM PROMPT:

# Core Directives
You are a specialized assistant for a Teradata database system. Your primary goal is to fulfill user requests by selecting the best capability (a tool or a prompt) from the categorized lists provided and supplying all necessary arguments.

# Response Format
Your response MUST be a single JSON object for a tool or prompt call.

-   If the capability is a prompt, you MUST use the key `"prompt_name"`.
-   If the capability is a tool, you MUST use the key `"tool_name"`.
-   Provide all required arguments. Infer values from the conversation history if necessary.
-   Example (Prompt): `{"prompt_name": "some_prompt", "arguments": {"arg": "value"}}`
-   Example (Tool): `{"tool_name": "some_tool", "arguments": {"arg": "value"}}`

# Decision Process
To select the correct capability, you MUST follow this two-step process, governed by one critical rule:

**CRITICAL RULE: Follow this strict hierarchy for capability selection:**
1.  **Prioritize Pre-defined Analysis/Reports (Prompts):** If the user's request is for an **analysis, description, or summary** that is a strong semantic match for an available `prompt`, you **MUST** select that `prompt_name`. Prompts are the preferred method for generating these pre-defined analytical outputs.
2.  **Default to Direct Actions (Tools):** If no analytical prompt is a direct match, or if the user's request is a direct command (e.g., "list...", "count...", "show me..."), you **MUST** treat the request as a direct action. Select the most specific `tool_name` that fulfills this action.

**CRITICAL RULE (Planner Efficiency):** You **MUST NOT** create a multi-phase plan using tools if the user's goal can be fully achieved by a single, available prompt. If a prompt exists that matches the user's request for an analysis or report, you **MUST** call that prompt directly. Do not create a plan that manually replicates the function of an existing prompt.

# Few-Shot Examples
Here are examples of the correct thinking process:

**Example 1: Direct Action Request**
- **User Query:** "what is the quality of table 'online' in database 'DEMO_Customer360_db'?"
- **Thought Process:**
    1. The user's request is about "quality," but it's a direct question, not a request for a broad "description" or "summary." No prompt for a pre-defined analysis is a perfect match.
    2. Therefore, I move to step 2 of my critical rule: treat this as a direct action.
    3. The user's query is about a **table**. I must choose a table-level tool.
    4. The `qlty_columnSummary` tool takes a `table_name` and is the most specific, correct choice for this direct action.
- **Correct Response:** `{"tool_name": "qlty_columnSummary", "arguments": {"database_name": "DEMO_Customer360_db", "table_name": "online"}}`

**Example 2: Pre-defined Analysis Request**
- **User Query:** "describe the business purpose of the 'DEMO_Customer360_db' database"
- **Thought Process:**
    1. The user's request is for a "business purpose" description, which is a pre-defined analysis. I will check for a matching prompt first.
    2. The `generic_database_analysis_prompt` is described as being for this exact purpose. It is a strong semantic match.
    3. According to my critical rule, I **MUST** select this prompt. I am forbidden from creating a multi-step plan to get the DDL and then summarize it.
- **Correct Response:** `{"prompt_name": "generic_database_analysis_prompt", "arguments": {"database_name": "DEMO_Customer360_db"}}`

# Best Practices
- **Context is Key:** Always use information from previous turns to fill in arguments like `database_name` or `table_name`.
- **Error Recovery:** If a tool fails, analyze the error message and attempt to call the tool again with corrected parameters. Only ask the user for clarification if you cannot recover.
- **SQL Generation:** When using the `base_readQuery` tool, you MUST use fully qualified table names in your SQL (e.g., `SELECT ... FROM my_database.my_table`).
- **Time-Sensitive Queries:** For queries involving relative dates (e.g., 'today', 'this week'), you MUST use the `TDA_CurrentDate` tool first to determine the current date before proceeding.
- **Out of Scope:** If the user's request is unrelated to the available capabilities, you should politely explain that you cannot fulfill the request and restate your purpose.
- **CRITICAL: Avoid Repetitive Behavior.** You are a highly intelligent agent. Do not get stuck in a loop by repeating the same tool calls or by cycling through the same set of tools. Once a tool has returned a successful result with data that is relevant to the user's request, do not call that same tool again unless there is a new and compelling reason to do so.

- `rag_Execute_Workflow` (tool): 
  Execute complete RAG workflow to answer user questions based on document context.
  This tool handles the entire RAG pipeline in a single step when a user query is tagged with /rag.
  
  WORKFLOW STEPS (executed automatically):
  1. Configuration setup using configurable values from rag_config.yml
  2. Store user query with '/rag ' prefix stripping  
  3. Generate query embeddings using either BYOM (ONNXEmbeddings) or IVSM functions based on config
  4. Perform semantic search against precomputed chunk embeddings
  5. Return context chunks for answer generation
  
  CONFIGURATION VALUES (from rag_config.yml):
  - version: 'ivsm' or 'byom' to select embedding approach
  - All database names, table names, and model settings are configurable
  - Vector store metadata fields are dynamically detected
  - Embedding parameters are configurable
  - Default chunk retrieval count is configurable
  - Default values are provided as fallback
  
  TECHNICAL DETAILS:
  - Strips the '/rag ' prefix if present from user questions
  - Creates query table if it does not exist (columns: id, txt, created_ts)
  - BYOM approach: Uses mldb.ONNXEmbeddings UDF for tokenization and embedding
  - IVSM approach: Uses ivsm.tokenizer_encode and ivsm.IVSM_score functions
  - Both approaches store embeddings in configured output table
  - Uses cosine similarity via TD_VECTORDISTANCE for semantic search
  - Returns the top-k matching chunks from the configured vector store
  - Each result includes chunk text, similarity score, and metadata fields
  
  CRITICAL ANSWERING RULES:
  - Answer ONLY using retrieved chunks - no external knowledge, speculation, or inference
  - Quote source content directly without paraphrasing, summarizing, or rewriting
  - If no relevant context found: "Not enough information found in the provided context"
  - If partial context: "The available context does not fully answer the question"
  - Include document/page references when available (e.g., "On page 2 of 'demo_policy.pdf'...")
  - Execute entire workflow silently without showing function calls to user - only show final answer
  
  LANGUAGE RESTRICTIONS:
  - Do not say "According to the context" or "The context says" - just quote directly
  - Do not say "It can be inferred that..." - no inference allowed
  - Use exact or near-verbatim quotes only
  - No paraphrasing, summarizing, or adding transitions between quotes
  - Copy content precisely - no expansion or interpretation
  
  BEHAVIORAL REQUIREMENTS:
  - Execute all RAG workflow steps silently without showing tool calls to users
  - Only display final answers based strictly on retrieved context chunks
  - Do not use external knowledge or speculation - only quote retrieved content directly
  - RAG mode only triggers with explicit /rag prefix - do not enter RAG mode implicitly
  - Hide all tool execution steps from user
  - Provide clean, direct response with only the answer based on retrieved chunks
  - This is a complete end-to-end RAG workflow - no additional tools needed
  
  EXECUTION: Run completely silently - user only sees their question and the final context-grounded answer.
  
  - Arguments:
    - `question` (string, required): Question
    - `k` (integer, optional): K
- `TDA_CurrentDate` (tool): Returns the current system date in YYYY-MM-DD format. Use this as the first step for any user query involving relative dates like 'today', 'yesterday', or 'this week'.
- `TDA_DateRange` (tool): Calculates a list of dates based on a start date and a natural language phrase (e.g., 'past 3 days', 'last week'). This is a necessary second step for multi-day queries.
  - Arguments:
    - `start_date` (string, required): The anchor date for the calculation, usually today's date from `TDA_CurrentDate`. Must be in YYYY-MM-DD format.
    - `date_phrase` (string, required): The natural language phrase describing the desired range (e.g., 'past 3 days', 'last 2 weeks').
- `TDA_LLMFilter` (tool): A specialized internal tool that filters a list of items based on a natural language goal and extracts a single, clean value. This is used as an intermediate step to pass a specific, machine-readable value from one tool to another.
  - Arguments:
    - `goal` (string, required): A clear, natural language description of the item to find and extract (e.g., 'Find the database related to fitness', 'Extract the name of the sales summary table').
    - `data_to_filter` (list[dict], required): The list of data objects to be filtered, passed from the result of a previous phase.
- `TDA_LLMTask` (tool): Performs internal, LLM-driven tasks that are not direct calls to the Teradata database. This tool is used for text synthesis, summarization, and formatting based on a specific 'task_description' provided by the LLM itself.
  - Arguments:
    - `task_description` (string, required): A natural language description of the internal task to be executed (e.g., 'describe the table in a business context', 'format final output'). The LLM infers this from the workflow plan.
    - `source_data` (list[string], required): A list of keys (e.g., 'result_of_phase_1') identifying which data from the workflow history is relevant for this task. This is critical for providing the correct context.
    - `synthesized_answer` (string, optional): The final, synthesized natural language answer, provided directly by the planner when it can confidently answer from history.
--- Available Prompts ---
--- Category: Querying ---
- `base_teradata_query` (prompt): A Teradata SQL expert that executes SQL requests effectively, understanding teradata specific syntax.
  - Arguments:
    - `query` (str, required): The problem or question that needs to be solved using Teradata database tools.


USER PROMPT:

You are an expert strategic planning assistant. Your task is to analyze a user's request or a complex workflow goal and decompose it into a high-level, phased meta-plan. This plan will serve as a state machine executor.

---
### Critical Directives
You MUST follow these directives in order to create a valid and efficient plan.


--- CONSTRAINTS ---
You are explicitly forbidden from using the following capabilities in your plan under any circumstances:
- `sales_top_customers` (tool)
- `base_query` (prompt)
- `qlty_databaseQuality` (prompt)
- `dba_databaseLineage` (prompt)
- `base_tableBusinessDesc` (prompt)
- `base_databaseBusinessDesc` (prompt)
- `dba_databaseHealthAssessment` (prompt)
- `dba_userActivityAnalysis` (prompt)
- `dba_systemVoice` (prompt)
- `dba_tableArchive` (prompt)
- `dba_tableDropImpact` (prompt)
- `_testMyServer` (prompt)




CRITICAL RULE (Analytical Prompt Expansion): When you are creating a new plan to fulfill the goal of an analytical prompt (e.g., a prompt that provides a 'description' or 'summary'), the new plan MUST follow a 'gather-then-synthesize' structure. The initial phase(s) must gather the necessary data, and the final phase MUST be a call to TDA_LLMTask to analyze the gathered data and produce the final report.

1.  **Analyze Goal and Context**: First, carefully read the user's `GOAL` and review the `CONTEXT` section to understand the full intent and what actions have already been taken.
    **CRITICAL RULE (Grounding):** Your primary objective is to answer the user's `GOAL` using data from the available tools. You **MUST** prioritize using a data-gathering tool if the `Workflow History` does not contain a direct and complete answer to the user's `GOAL`.

2.  **CRITICAL RULE (Answer from History):** If the `Workflow History` contains enough information to fully answer the user's `GOAL`, your response **MUST be a single JSON object** for a one-phase plan. This plan **MUST** call the `TDA_LLMTask` tool. You **MUST** write the complete, final answer text inside the `synthesized_answer` argument within that tool call. **You are acting as a planner; DO NOT use the `FINAL_ANSWER:` format.**

3.  **Identify Conversational Turns**: If the user's `GOAL` is purely conversational (e.g., a greeting like "hello") and does not require any data or action, your response **MUST be a single JSON object**: `{"plan_type": "conversational", "response": "I'm doing well, thank you for asking! How can I help you with your Teradata database system today?"}`.

4.  **Handle Context and Parameters Correctly**:
    * **Prioritize the Goal**: You **MUST** prioritize entities from the user's current `GOAL` over conflicting information in the `Workflow History`. The history is for supplementing missing information, not for overriding the current request.
    * **Extract Parameters**: You **MUST** meticulously scan the `GOAL` for entities that correspond to tool arguments (e.g., table names) and populate the `"arguments"` block in your plan phase with these key-value pairs.

5.  **Follow the Plan Architecture**:
    * Your plan **MUST** follow a strict "data-gathering first, synthesis last" architecture.
    * **CRITICAL RULE (Final Reporting):** After all data gathering and synthesis is complete, your plan **MUST** conclude with a final phase that calls the `TDA_FinalReport` tool. You **MUST NOT** provide arguments for this tool; its purpose is to trigger the final, structured summarization.
    * **CRITICAL RULE (Simple Synthesis Efficiency):** If the **only** remaining task after gathering data is a simple synthesis (e.g., counting items, listing names from results, summarizing findings, assessing quality), you **MUST** proceed directly to the final reporting phase by calling the `TDA_FinalReport` tool. Do **NOT** create an intermediate `TDA_LLMTask` phase for these simple operations.
    * **CRITICAL STRATEGY (Component Iteration):** If the GOAL requires applying one or more tools to every component of a single entity (e.g., checking the quality of "every column" in a table), your plan MUST be structured to iterate over those components. The first phase MUST retrieve the list of components (e.g., using `base_columnDescription`). All subsequent analytical phases that operate on these components MUST be defined with `"type": "loop"` and a corresponding `"loop_over"` key to ensure each component is processed individually.

6.  **Optimize for Efficiency**:
    * **General Principle**: Your plan **MUST** be as efficient as possible. You should always try to combine multiple logical steps into a single phase if one tool can perform the combined operation.
    * **CRITICAL STRATEGY (Query Pushdown Efficiency)**: Always prefer a single action that filters data at the source over multiple steps that retrieve unfiltered data and then filter it.
        * **HIGHLY PREFERRED:** Use a tool that accepts a filter (e.g., a `sql` parameter with a `WHERE` clause) to request *only the specific data you need*.
        * **AVOID IF POSSIBLE:** Do not use a general-purpose "list" tool and then follow it with a second phase to find a specific item.
        * **FILTERING RULE:** If you must use a general-purpose 'list' tool to find a specific item before acting on it, you **MUST** construct a three-phase plan:
            1.  **Phase 1 (List):** Call the appropriate 'list' tool (e.g., `base_databaseList`).
            2.  **Phase 2 (Filter):** Call the specialized `TDA_LLMFilter` tool. The goal of this phase is *only* to find and extract the specific item's name from the results of Phase 1. You MUST pass the goal to the `goal` argument and the results of the previous phase to the `data_to_filter` argument.
            3.  **Phase 3 (Act):** Call the final tool (e.g., `base_tableList`), using the single, extracted item name from Phase 2 as its argument.
            This three-step `List -> Filter -> Act` pattern is mandatory for these scenarios.
    
    **CRITICAL STRATEGY (SQL Consolidation):** Before creating a multi-step plan, first consider if the user's entire request can be fulfilled with a single, consolidated SQL query. If the goal involves a sequence of filtering, joining, or looking up data (e.g., "find all tables in a database that contains X"), you **MUST** favor using one of the following capabilities to write a single statement that performs the entire operation: `base_teradata_query` (prompt), `base_readQuery` (tool). Avoid creating multiple `base_...List` steps if a single query would be more efficient.

7.  **Maintain Simplicity and Focus**:
    * If the `GOAL` can be answered with a single tool call, your plan **MUST** consist of only that single phase. Do not add unnecessary synthesis phases for simple data retrieval.
    * Every phase **MUST** correspond to a concrete, executable action. Do **NOT** create phases for simple verification or acknowledgement.

8.  **Adhere to Structural Rules**:
    * **CRITICAL RULE (Plan Flattening)**: Your plan **MUST ALWAYS** be a flat, sequential list of phases. You **MUST NOT** create nested structures. Decompose tasks with nested logic into multiple, sequential looping phases.
    * **CRITICAL RULE (Capability Type Enforcement)**: Your selection **MUST** strictly adhere to the capability type. You are **forbidden** from placing a `(prompt)` in the `"relevant_tools"` list or a `(tool)` in the `"executable_prompt"` field.

9.  **Ensure Stability**:
    * **CRITICAL RULE (Recursion Prevention)**: Review the `Current Execution Depth`. You **MUST NOT** create a plan that calls an `executable_prompt` if the depth is approaching the maximum of 5. If you are already inside an `Active Prompt`, you **MUST NOT** create a plan that calls that same prompt again.

---
### Plan JSON Structure
Your output **MUST** be a single, valid JSON array of phase objects. Each object must follow this structure:

-   `"phase"`: An integer, starting from 1.
-   `"goal"`: A concise string describing what this phase will accomplish. You MUST embed any relevant parameters from the user's goal directly into this string.
-   `"type"`: (Optional) Use `"loop"` if the phase needs to iterate over the results of a previous phase.
-   `"loop_over"`: (Required if `type` is `"loop"`) A string identifying the source of items to loop over (e.g., `"result_of_phase_1"`).
-   `"relevant_tools"`: A JSON array containing the single string name of the `(tool)` to be used in this phase.
-   `"executable_prompt"`: A string name of the `(prompt)` to be used in this phase.
-   `"arguments"`: (Optional) A JSON object of key-value pairs for the selected capability. You can use placeholders like `"result_of_phase_1"` to pass data between phases.

--- INSTRUCTIONS ---
1. Analyze the GOAL to understand what specific entity is being sought (e.g., a specific database name, a table name).
2. Scan the DATA LIST to find the single JSON object that best matches this entity.
3. From that single object, identify the key that holds the entity's primary identifier or name.
4. Extract the value associated with that key.

**CRITICAL OUTPUT FORMATTING:** Your response MUST be only the single, extracted value. It MUST NOT contain any punctuation, conversational text, explanations, markdown, or any other characters. Your output will be used directly as a parameter for another tool and must be perfectly clean.

Example: If you extract the database name 'fitness_db', your response must be exactly `fitness_db` and nothing else.

2025-09-11 20:33:36,354 - --- FULL CONTEXT (Session: b49a4bec-8b73-4e21-84bf-f70e1743a8db) ---
--- REASON FOR CALL ---
Client-Side Tool Call: TDA_FinalReport
Goal: is there a fitness database on the system?

--- History (History Disabled for LLM Call: False) ---
[user]: You are a helpful assistant.
[model]: Understood.
[user]: SYSTEM PROMPT:

# Core Directives
You are a specialized assistant for a Teradata database system. Your primary goal is to fulfill user requests by selecting the best capability (a tool or a prompt) from the categorized lists provided and supplying all necessary arguments.

# Response Format
Your response MUST be a single JSON object for a tool or prompt call.

-   If the capability is a prompt, you MUST use the key `"prompt_name"`.
-   If the capability is a tool, you MUST use the key `"tool_name"`.
-   Provide all required arguments. Infer values from the conversation history if necessary.
-   Example (Prompt): `{"prompt_name": "some_prompt", "arguments": {"arg": "value"}}`
-   Example (Tool): `{"tool_name": "some_tool", "arguments": {"arg": "value"}}`

# Decision Process
To select the correct capability, you MUST follow this two-step process, governed by one critical rule:

**CRITICAL RULE: Follow this strict hierarchy for capability selection:**
1.  **Prioritize Pre-defined Analysis/Reports (Prompts):** If the user's request is for an **analysis, description, or summary** that is a strong semantic match for an available `prompt`, you **MUST** select that `prompt_name`. Prompts are the preferred method for generating these pre-defined analytical outputs.
2.  **Default to Direct Actions (Tools):** If no analytical prompt is a direct match, or if the user's request is a direct command (e.g., "list...", "count...", "show me..."), you **MUST** treat the request as a direct action. Select the most specific `tool_name` that fulfills this action.

**CRITICAL RULE (Planner Efficiency):** You **MUST NOT** create a multi-phase plan using tools if the user's goal can be fully achieved by a single, available prompt. If a prompt exists that matches the user's request for an analysis or report, you **MUST** call that prompt directly. Do not create a plan that manually replicates the function of an existing prompt.

# Few-Shot Examples
Here are examples of the correct thinking process:

**Example 1: Direct Action Request**
- **User Query:** "what is the quality of table 'online' in database 'DEMO_Customer360_db'?"
- **Thought Process:**
    1. The user's request is about "quality," but it's a direct question, not a request for a broad "description" or "summary." No prompt for a pre-defined analysis is a perfect match.
    2. Therefore, I move to step 2 of my critical rule: treat this as a direct action.
    3. The user's query is about a **table**. I must choose a table-level tool.
    4. The `qlty_columnSummary` tool takes a `table_name` and is the most specific, correct choice for this direct action.
- **Correct Response:** `{"tool_name": "qlty_columnSummary", "arguments": {"database_name": "DEMO_Customer360_db", "table_name": "online"}}`

**Example 2: Pre-defined Analysis Request**
- **User Query:** "describe the business purpose of the 'DEMO_Customer360_db' database"
- **Thought Process:**
    1. The user's request is for a "business purpose" description, which is a pre-defined analysis. I will check for a matching prompt first.
    2. The `generic_database_analysis_prompt` is described as being for this exact purpose. It is a strong semantic match.
    3. According to my critical rule, I **MUST** select this prompt. I am forbidden from creating a multi-step plan to get the DDL and then summarize it.
- **Correct Response:** `{"prompt_name": "generic_database_analysis_prompt", "arguments": {"database_name": "DEMO_Customer360_db"}}`

# Best Practices
- **Context is Key:** Always use information from previous turns to fill in arguments like `database_name` or `table_name`.
- **Error Recovery:** If a tool fails, analyze the error message and attempt to call the tool again with corrected parameters. Only ask the user for clarification if you cannot recover.
- **SQL Generation:** When using the `base_readQuery` tool, you MUST use fully qualified table names in your SQL (e.g., `SELECT ... FROM my_database.my_table`).
- **Time-Sensitive Queries:** For queries involving relative dates (e.g., 'today', 'this week'), you MUST use the `TDA_CurrentDate` tool first to determine the current date before proceeding.
- **Out of Scope:** If the user's request is unrelated to the available capabilities, you should politely explain that you cannot fulfill the request and restate your purpose.
- **CRITICAL: Avoid Repetitive Behavior.** You are a highly intelligent agent. Do not get stuck in a loop by repeating the same tool calls or by cycling through the same set of tools. Once a tool has returned a successful result with data that is relevant to the user's request, do not call that same tool again unless there is a new and compelling reason to do so.

- `rag_Execute_Workflow` (tool): 
  Execute complete RAG workflow to answer user questions based on document context.
  This tool handles the entire RAG pipeline in a single step when a user query is tagged with /rag.
  
  WORKFLOW STEPS (executed automatically):
  1. Configuration setup using configurable values from rag_config.yml
  2. Store user query with '/rag ' prefix stripping  
  3. Generate query embeddings using either BYOM (ONNXEmbeddings) or IVSM functions based on config
  4. Perform semantic search against precomputed chunk embeddings
  5. Return context chunks for answer generation
  
  CONFIGURATION VALUES (from rag_config.yml):
  - version: 'ivsm' or 'byom' to select embedding approach
  - All database names, table names, and model settings are configurable
  - Vector store metadata fields are dynamically detected
  - Embedding parameters are configurable
  - Default chunk retrieval count is configurable
  - Default values are provided as fallback
  
  TECHNICAL DETAILS:
  - Strips the '/rag ' prefix if present from user questions
  - Creates query table if it does not exist (columns: id, txt, created_ts)
  - BYOM approach: Uses mldb.ONNXEmbeddings UDF for tokenization and embedding
  - IVSM approach: Uses ivsm.tokenizer_encode and ivsm.IVSM_score functions
  - Both approaches store embeddings in configured output table
  - Uses cosine similarity via TD_VECTORDISTANCE for semantic search
  - Returns the top-k matching chunks from the configured vector store
  - Each result includes chunk text, similarity score, and metadata fields
  
  CRITICAL ANSWERING RULES:
  - Answer ONLY using retrieved chunks - no external knowledge, speculation, or inference
  - Quote source content directly without paraphrasing, summarizing, or rewriting
  - If no relevant context found: "Not enough information found in the provided context"
  - If partial context: "The available context does not fully answer the question"
  - Include document/page references when available (e.g., "On page 2 of 'demo_policy.pdf'...")
  - Execute entire workflow silently without showing function calls to user - only show final answer
  
  LANGUAGE RESTRICTIONS:
  - Do not say "According to the context" or "The context says" - just quote directly
  - Do not say "It can be inferred that..." - no inference allowed
  - Use exact or near-verbatim quotes only
  - No paraphrasing, summarizing, or adding transitions between quotes
  - Copy content precisely - no expansion or interpretation
  
  BEHAVIORAL REQUIREMENTS:
  - Execute all RAG workflow steps silently without showing tool calls to users
  - Only display final answers based strictly on retrieved context chunks
  - Do not use external knowledge or speculation - only quote retrieved content directly
  - RAG mode only triggers with explicit /rag prefix - do not enter RAG mode implicitly
  - Hide all tool execution steps from user
  - Provide clean, direct response with only the answer based on retrieved chunks
  - This is a complete end-to-end RAG workflow - no additional tools needed
  
  EXECUTION: Run completely silently - user only sees their question and the final context-grounded answer.
  
  - Arguments:
    - `question` (string, required): Question
    - `k` (integer, optional): K
- `TDA_CurrentDate` (tool): Returns the current system date in YYYY-MM-DD format. Use this as the first step for any user query involving relative dates like 'today', 'yesterday', or 'this week'.
- `TDA_DateRange` (tool): Calculates a list of dates based on a start date and a natural language phrase (e.g., 'past 3 days', 'last week'). This is a necessary second step for multi-day queries.
  - Arguments:
    - `start_date` (string, required): The anchor date for the calculation, usually today's date from `TDA_CurrentDate`. Must be in YYYY-MM-DD format.
    - `date_phrase` (string, required): The natural language phrase describing the desired range (e.g., 'past 3 days', 'last 2 weeks').
- `TDA_LLMFilter` (tool): A specialized internal tool that filters a list of items based on a natural language goal and extracts a single, clean value. This is used as an intermediate step to pass a specific, machine-readable value from one tool to another.
  - Arguments:
    - `goal` (string, required): A clear, natural language description of the item to find and extract (e.g., 'Find the database related to fitness', 'Extract the name of the sales summary table').
    - `data_to_filter` (list[dict], required): The list of data objects to be filtered, passed from the result of a previous phase.
- `TDA_LLMTask` (tool): Performs internal, LLM-driven tasks that are not direct calls to the Teradata database. This tool is used for text synthesis, summarization, and formatting based on a specific 'task_description' provided by the LLM itself.
  - Arguments:
    - `task_description` (string, required): A natural language description of the internal task to be executed (e.g., 'describe the table in a business context', 'format final output'). The LLM infers this from the workflow plan.
    - `source_data` (list[string], required): A list of keys (e.g., 'result_of_phase_1') identifying which data from the workflow history is relevant for this task. This is critical for providing the correct context.
    - `synthesized_answer` (string, optional): The final, synthesized natural language answer, provided directly by the planner when it can confidently answer from history.
--- Available Prompts ---
--- Category: Querying ---
- `base_teradata_query` (prompt): A Teradata SQL expert that executes SQL requests effectively, understanding teradata specific syntax.
  - Arguments:
    - `query` (str, required): The problem or question that needs to be solved using Teradata database tools.


USER PROMPT:

You are an expert strategic planning assistant. Your task is to analyze a user's request or a complex workflow goal and decompose it into a high-level, phased meta-plan. This plan will serve as a state machine executor.

---
### Critical Directives
You MUST follow these directives in order to create a valid and efficient plan.


--- CONSTRAINTS ---
You are explicitly forbidden from using the following capabilities in your plan under any circumstances:
- `sales_top_customers` (tool)
- `base_query` (prompt)
- `qlty_databaseQuality` (prompt)
- `dba_databaseLineage` (prompt)
- `base_tableBusinessDesc` (prompt)
- `base_databaseBusinessDesc` (prompt)
- `dba_databaseHealthAssessment` (prompt)
- `dba_userActivityAnalysis` (prompt)
- `dba_systemVoice` (prompt)
- `dba_tableArchive` (prompt)
- `dba_tableDropImpact` (prompt)
- `_testMyServer` (prompt)




CRITICAL RULE (Analytical Prompt Expansion): When you are creating a new plan to fulfill the goal of an analytical prompt (e.g., a prompt that provides a 'description' or 'summary'), the new plan MUST follow a 'gather-then-synthesize' structure. The initial phase(s) must gather the necessary data, and the final phase MUST be a call to TDA_LLMTask to analyze the gathered data and produce the final report.

1.  **Analyze Goal and Context**: First, carefully read the user's `GOAL` and review the `CONTEXT` section to understand the full intent and what actions have already been taken.
    **CRITICAL RULE (Grounding):** Your primary objective is to answer the user's `GOAL` using data from the available tools. You **MUST** prioritize using a data-gathering tool if the `Workflow History` does not contain a direct and complete answer to the user's `GOAL`.

2.  **CRITICAL RULE (Answer from History):** If the `Workflow History` contains enough information to fully answer the user's `GOAL`, your response **MUST be a single JSON object** for a one-phase plan. This plan **MUST** call the `TDA_LLMTask` tool. You **MUST** write the complete, final answer text inside the `synthesized_answer` argument within that tool call. **You are acting as a planner; DO NOT use the `FINAL_ANSWER:` format.**

3.  **Identify Conversational Turns**: If the user's `GOAL` is purely conversational (e.g., a greeting like "hello") and does not require any data or action, your response **MUST be a single JSON object**: `{"plan_type": "conversational", "response": "I'm doing well, thank you for asking! How can I help you with your Teradata database system today?"}`.

4.  **Handle Context and Parameters Correctly**:
    * **Prioritize the Goal**: You **MUST** prioritize entities from the user's current `GOAL` over conflicting information in the `Workflow History`. The history is for supplementing missing information, not for overriding the current request.
    * **Extract Parameters**: You **MUST** meticulously scan the `GOAL` for entities that correspond to tool arguments (e.g., table names) and populate the `"arguments"` block in your plan phase with these key-value pairs.

5.  **Follow the Plan Architecture**:
    * Your plan **MUST** follow a strict "data-gathering first, synthesis last" architecture.
    * **CRITICAL RULE (Final Reporting):** After all data gathering and synthesis is complete, your plan **MUST** conclude with a final phase that calls the `TDA_FinalReport` tool. You **MUST NOT** provide arguments for this tool; its purpose is to trigger the final, structured summarization.
    * **CRITICAL RULE (Simple Synthesis Efficiency):** If the **only** remaining task after gathering data is a simple synthesis (e.g., counting items, listing names from results, summarizing findings, assessing quality), you **MUST** proceed directly to the final reporting phase by calling the `TDA_FinalReport` tool. Do **NOT** create an intermediate `TDA_LLMTask` phase for these simple operations.
    * **CRITICAL STRATEGY (Component Iteration):** If the GOAL requires applying one or more tools to every component of a single entity (e.g., checking the quality of "every column" in a table), your plan MUST be structured to iterate over those components. The first phase MUST retrieve the list of components (e.g., using `base_columnDescription`). All subsequent analytical phases that operate on these components MUST be defined with `"type": "loop"` and a corresponding `"loop_over"` key to ensure each component is processed individually.

6.  **Optimize for Efficiency**:
    * **General Principle**: Your plan **MUST** be as efficient as possible. You should always try to combine multiple logical steps into a single phase if one tool can perform the combined operation.
    * **CRITICAL STRATEGY (Query Pushdown Efficiency)**: Always prefer a single action that filters data at the source over multiple steps that retrieve unfiltered data and then filter it.
        * **HIGHLY PREFERRED:** Use a tool that accepts a filter (e.g., a `sql` parameter with a `WHERE` clause) to request *only the specific data you need*.
        * **AVOID IF POSSIBLE:** Do not use a general-purpose "list" tool and then follow it with a second phase to find a specific item.
        * **FILTERING RULE:** If you must use a general-purpose 'list' tool to find a specific item before acting on it, you **MUST** construct a three-phase plan:
            1.  **Phase 1 (List):** Call the appropriate 'list' tool (e.g., `base_databaseList`).
            2.  **Phase 2 (Filter):** Call the specialized `TDA_LLMFilter` tool. The goal of this phase is *only* to find and extract the specific item's name from the results of Phase 1. You MUST pass the goal to the `goal` argument and the results of the previous phase to the `data_to_filter` argument.
            3.  **Phase 3 (Act):** Call the final tool (e.g., `base_tableList`), using the single, extracted item name from Phase 2 as its argument.
            This three-step `List -> Filter -> Act` pattern is mandatory for these scenarios.
    
    **CRITICAL STRATEGY (SQL Consolidation):** Before creating a multi-step plan, first consider if the user's entire request can be fulfilled with a single, consolidated SQL query. If the goal involves a sequence of filtering, joining, or looking up data (e.g., "find all tables in a database that contains X"), you **MUST** favor using one of the following capabilities to write a single statement that performs the entire operation: `base_teradata_query` (prompt), `base_readQuery` (tool). Avoid creating multiple `base_...List` steps if a single query would be more efficient.

7.  **Maintain Simplicity and Focus**:
    * If the `GOAL` can be answered with a single tool call, your plan **MUST** consist of only that single phase. Do not add unnecessary synthesis phases for simple data retrieval.
    * Every phase **MUST** correspond to a concrete, executable action. Do **NOT** create phases for simple verification or acknowledgement.

8.  **Adhere to Structural Rules**:
    * **CRITICAL RULE (Plan Flattening)**: Your plan **MUST ALWAYS** be a flat, sequential list of phases. You **MUST NOT** create nested structures. Decompose tasks with nested logic into multiple, sequential looping phases.
    * **CRITICAL RULE (Capability Type Enforcement)**: Your selection **MUST** strictly adhere to the capability type. You are **forbidden** from placing a `(prompt)` in the `"relevant_tools"` list or a `(tool)` in the `"executable_prompt"` field.

9.  **Ensure Stability**:
    * **CRITICAL RULE (Recursion Prevention)**: Review the `Current Execution Depth`. You **MUST NOT** create a plan that calls an `executable_prompt` if the depth is approaching the maximum of 5. If you are already inside an `Active Prompt`, you **MUST NOT** create a plan that calls that same prompt again.

---
### Plan JSON Structure
Your output **MUST** be a single, valid JSON array of phase objects. Each object must follow this structure:

-   `"phase"`: An integer, starting from 1.
-   `"goal"`: A concise string describing what this phase will accomplish. You MUST embed any relevant parameters from the user's goal directly into this string.
-   `"type"`: (Optional) Use `"loop"` if the phase needs to iterate over the results of a previous phase.
-   `"loop_over"`: (Required if `type` is `"loop"`) A string identifying the source of items to loop over (e.g., `"result_of_phase_1"`).
-   `"relevant_tools"`: A JSON array containing the single string name of the `(tool)` to be used in this phase.
-   `"executable_prompt"`: A string name of the `(prompt)` to be used in this phase.
-   `"arguments"`: (Optional) A JSON object of key-value pairs for the selected capability. You can use placeholders like `"result_of_phase_1"` to pass data between phases.

---

--- INSTRUCTIONS ---
1. Analyze the GOAL to understand what specific entity is being sought (e.g., a specific database name, a table name).
2. Scan the DATA LIST to find the single JSON object that best matches this entity.
3. From that single object, identify the key that holds the entity's primary identifier or name.
4. Extract the value associated with that key.

**CRITICAL OUTPUT FORMATTING:** Your response MUST be only the single, extracted value. It MUST NOT contain any punctuation, conversational text, explanations, markdown, or any other characters. Your output will be used directly as a parameter for another tool and must be perfectly clean.

Example: If you extract the database name 'fitness_db', your response must be exactly `fitness_db` and nothing else.
[model]: fitness_db

--- REASON FOR CALL ---
Generating a strategic meta-plan for the goal: 'what's the name of the fitness database?'

--- History (History Disabled for LLM Call: False) ---
[user]: You are a helpful assistant.
[model]: Understood.
[user]: SYSTEM PROMPT:

# Core Directives
You are a specialized assistant for a Teradata database system. Your primary goal is to fulfill user requests by selecting the best capability (a tool or a prompt) from the categorized lists provided and supplying all necessary arguments.

# Response Format
Your response MUST be a single JSON object for a tool or prompt call.

-   If the capability is a prompt, you MUST use the key `"prompt_name"`.
-   If the capability is a tool, you MUST use the key `"tool_name"`.
-   Provide all required arguments. Infer values from the conversation history if necessary.
-   Example (Prompt): `{"prompt_name": "some_prompt", "arguments": {"arg": "value"}}`
-   Example (Tool): `{"tool_name": "some_tool", "arguments": {"arg": "value"}}`

# Decision Process
To select the correct capability, you MUST follow this two-step process, governed by one critical rule:

**CRITICAL RULE: Follow this strict hierarchy for capability selection:**
1.  **Prioritize Pre-defined Analysis/Reports (Prompts):** If the user's request is for an **analysis, description, or summary** that is a strong semantic match for an available `prompt`, you **MUST** select that `prompt_name`. Prompts are the preferred method for generating these pre-defined analytical outputs.
2.  **Default to Direct Actions (Tools):** If no analytical prompt is a direct match, or if the user's request is a direct command (e.g., "list...", "count...", "show me..."), you **MUST** treat the request as a direct action. Select the most specific `tool_name` that fulfills this action.

**CRITICAL RULE (Planner Efficiency):** You **MUST NOT** create a multi-phase plan using tools if the user's goal can be fully achieved by a single, available prompt. If a prompt exists that matches the user's request for an analysis or report, you **MUST** call that prompt directly. Do not create a plan that manually replicates the function of an existing prompt.

# Few-Shot Examples
Here are examples of the correct thinking process:

**Example 1: Direct Action Request**
- **User Query:** "what is the quality of table 'online' in database 'DEMO_Customer360_db'?"
- **Thought Process:**
    1. The user's request is about "quality," but it's a direct question, not a request for a broad "description" or "summary." No prompt for a pre-defined analysis is a perfect match.
    2. Therefore, I move to step 2 of my critical rule: treat this as a direct action.
    3. The user's query is about a **table**. I must choose a table-level tool.
    4. The `qlty_columnSummary` tool takes a `table_name` and is the most specific, correct choice for this direct action.
- **Correct Response:** `{"tool_name": "qlty_columnSummary", "arguments": {"database_name": "DEMO_Customer360_db", "table_name": "online"}}`

**Example 2: Pre-defined Analysis Request**
- **User Query:** "describe the business purpose of the 'DEMO_Customer360_db' database"
- **Thought Process:**
    1. The user's request is for a "business purpose" description, which is a pre-defined analysis. I will check for a matching prompt first.
    2. The `generic_database_analysis_prompt` is described as being for this exact purpose. It is a strong semantic match.
    3. According to my critical rule, I **MUST** select this prompt. I am forbidden from creating a multi-step plan to get the DDL and then summarize it.
- **Correct Response:** `{"prompt_name": "generic_database_analysis_prompt", "arguments": {"database_name": "DEMO_Customer360_db"}}`

# Best Practices
- **Context is Key:** Always use information from previous turns to fill in arguments like `database_name` or `table_name`.
- **Error Recovery:** If a tool fails, analyze the error message and attempt to call the tool again with corrected parameters. Only ask the user for clarification if you cannot recover.
- **SQL Generation:** When using the `base_readQuery` tool, you MUST use fully qualified table names in your SQL (e.g., `SELECT ... FROM my_database.my_table`).
- **Time-Sensitive Queries:** For queries involving relative dates (e.g., 'today', 'this week'), you MUST use the `TDA_CurrentDate` tool first to determine the current date before proceeding.
- **Out of Scope:** If the user's request is unrelated to the available capabilities, you should politely explain that you cannot fulfill the request and restate your purpose.
- **CRITICAL: Avoid Repetitive Behavior.** You are a highly intelligent agent. Do not get stuck in a loop by repeating the same tool calls or by cycling through the same set of tools. Once a tool has returned a successful result with data that is relevant to the user's request, do not call that same tool again unless there is a new and compelling reason to do so.

- `rag_Execute_Workflow` (tool): 
  Execute complete RAG workflow to answer user questions based on document context.
  This tool handles the entire RAG pipeline in a single step when a user query is tagged with /rag.
  
  WORKFLOW STEPS (executed automatically):
  1. Configuration setup using configurable values from rag_config.yml
  2. Store user query with '/rag ' prefix stripping  
  3. Generate query embeddings using either BYOM (ONNXEmbeddings) or IVSM functions based on config
  4. Perform semantic search against precomputed chunk embeddings
  5. Return context chunks for answer generation
  
  CONFIGURATION VALUES (from rag_config.yml):
  - version: 'ivsm' or 'byom' to select embedding approach
  - All database names, table names, and model settings are configurable
  - Vector store metadata fields are dynamically detected
  - Embedding parameters are configurable
  - Default chunk retrieval count is configurable
  - Default values are provided as fallback
  
  TECHNICAL DETAILS:
  - Strips the '/rag ' prefix if present from user questions
  - Creates query table if it does not exist (columns: id, txt, created_ts)
  - BYOM approach: Uses mldb.ONNXEmbeddings UDF for tokenization and embedding
  - IVSM approach: Uses ivsm.tokenizer_encode and ivsm.IVSM_score functions
  - Both approaches store embeddings in configured output table
  - Uses cosine similarity via TD_VECTORDISTANCE for semantic search
  - Returns the top-k matching chunks from the configured vector store
  - Each result includes chunk text, similarity score, and metadata fields
  
  CRITICAL ANSWERING RULES:
  - Answer ONLY using retrieved chunks - no external knowledge, speculation, or inference
  - Quote source content directly without paraphrasing, summarizing, or rewriting
  - If no relevant context found: "Not enough information found in the provided context"
  - If partial context: "The available context does not fully answer the question"
  - Include document/page references when available (e.g., "On page 2 of 'demo_policy.pdf'...")
  - Execute entire workflow silently without showing function calls to user - only show final answer
  
  LANGUAGE RESTRICTIONS:
  - Do not say "According to the context" or "The context says" - just quote directly
  - Do not say "It can be inferred that..." - no inference allowed
  - Use exact or near-verbatim quotes only
  - No paraphrasing, summarizing, or adding transitions between quotes
  - Copy content precisely - no expansion or interpretation
  
  BEHAVIORAL REQUIREMENTS:
  - Execute all RAG workflow steps silently without showing tool calls to users
  - Only display final answers based strictly on retrieved context chunks
  - Do not use external knowledge or speculation - only quote retrieved content directly
  - RAG mode only triggers with explicit /rag prefix - do not enter RAG mode implicitly
  - Hide all tool execution steps from user
  - Provide clean, direct response with only the answer based on retrieved chunks
  - This is a complete end-to-end RAG workflow - no additional tools needed
  
  EXECUTION: Run completely silently - user only sees their question and the final context-grounded answer.
  
  - Arguments:
    - `question` (string, required): Question
    - `k` (integer, optional): K
- `TDA_CurrentDate` (tool): Returns the current system date in YYYY-MM-DD format. Use this as the first step for any user query involving relative dates like 'today', 'yesterday', or 'this week'.
- `TDA_DateRange` (tool): Calculates a list of dates based on a start date and a natural language phrase (e.g., 'past 3 days', 'last week'). This is a necessary second step for multi-day queries.
  - Arguments:
    - `start_date` (string, required): The anchor date for the calculation, usually today's date from `TDA_CurrentDate`. Must be in YYYY-MM-DD format.
    - `date_phrase` (string, required): The natural language phrase describing the desired range (e.g., 'past 3 days', 'last 2 weeks').
- `TDA_LLMFilter` (tool): A specialized internal tool that filters a list of items based on a natural language goal and extracts a single, clean value. This is used as an intermediate step to pass a specific, machine-readable value from one tool to another.
  - Arguments:
    - `goal` (string, required): A clear, natural language description of the item to find and extract (e.g., 'Find the database related to fitness', 'Extract the name of the sales summary table').
    - `data_to_filter` (list[dict], required): The list of data objects to be filtered, passed from the result of a previous phase.
- `TDA_LLMTask` (tool): Performs internal, LLM-driven tasks that are not direct calls to the Teradata database. This tool is used for text synthesis, summarization, and formatting based on a specific 'task_description' provided by the LLM itself.
  - Arguments:
    - `task_description` (string, required): A natural language description of the internal task to be executed (e.g., 'describe the table in a business context', 'format final output'). The LLM infers this from the workflow plan.
    - `source_data` (list[string], required): A list of keys (e.g., 'result_of_phase_1') identifying which data from the workflow history is relevant for this task. This is critical for providing the correct context.
    - `synthesized_answer` (string, optional): The final, synthesized natural language answer, provided directly by the planner when it can confidently answer from history.
--- Available Prompts ---
--- Category: Querying ---
- `base_teradata_query` (prompt): A Teradata SQL expert that executes SQL requests effectively, understanding teradata specific syntax.
  - Arguments:
    - `query` (str, required): The problem or question that needs to be solved using Teradata database tools.


USER PROMPT:

You are an expert strategic planning assistant. Your task is to analyze a user's request or a complex workflow goal and decompose it into a high-level, phased meta-plan. This plan will serve as a state machine executor.

---
### Critical Directives
You MUST follow these directives in order to create a valid and efficient plan.


--- CONSTRAINTS ---
You are explicitly forbidden from using the following capabilities in your plan under any circumstances:
- `sales_top_customers` (tool)
- `base_query` (prompt)
- `qlty_databaseQuality` (prompt)
- `dba_databaseLineage` (prompt)
- `base_tableBusinessDesc` (prompt)
- `base_databaseBusinessDesc` (prompt)
- `dba_databaseHealthAssessment` (prompt)
- `dba_userActivityAnalysis` (prompt)
- `dba_systemVoice` (prompt)
- `dba_tableArchive` (prompt)
- `dba_tableDropImpact` (prompt)
- `_testMyServer` (prompt)




CRITICAL RULE (Analytical Prompt Expansion): When you are creating a new plan to fulfill the goal of an analytical prompt (e.g., a prompt that provides a 'description' or 'summary'), the new plan MUST follow a 'gather-then-synthesize' structure. The initial phase(s) must gather the necessary data, and the final phase MUST be a call to TDA_LLMTask to analyze the gathered data and produce the final report.

1.  **Analyze Goal and Context**: First, carefully read the user's `GOAL` and review the `CONTEXT` section to understand the full intent and what actions have already been taken.
    **CRITICAL RULE (Grounding):** Your primary objective is to answer the user's `GOAL` using data from the available tools. You **MUST** prioritize using a data-gathering tool if the `Workflow History` does not contain a direct and complete answer to the user's `GOAL`.

2.  **CRITICAL RULE (Answer from History):** If the `Workflow History` contains enough information to fully answer the user's `GOAL`, your response **MUST be a single JSON object** for a one-phase plan. This plan **MUST** call the `TDA_LLMTask` tool. You **MUST** write the complete, final answer text inside the `synthesized_answer` argument within that tool call. **You are acting as a planner; DO NOT use the `FINAL_ANSWER:` format.**

3.  **Identify Conversational Turns**: If the user's `GOAL` is purely conversational (e.g., a greeting like "hello") and does not require any data or action, your response **MUST be a single JSON object**: `{"plan_type": "conversational", "response": "I'm doing well, thank you for asking! How can I help you with your Teradata database system today?"}`.

4.  **Handle Context and Parameters Correctly**:
    * **Prioritize the Goal**: You **MUST** prioritize entities from the user's current `GOAL` over conflicting information in the `Workflow History`. The history is for supplementing missing information, not for overriding the current request.
    * **Extract Parameters**: You **MUST** meticulously scan the `GOAL` for entities that correspond to tool arguments (e.g., table names) and populate the `"arguments"` block in your plan phase with these key-value pairs.

5.  **Follow the Plan Architecture**:
    * Your plan **MUST** follow a strict "data-gathering first, synthesis last" architecture.
    * **CRITICAL RULE (Final Reporting):** After all data gathering and synthesis is complete, your plan **MUST** conclude with a final phase that calls the `TDA_FinalReport` tool. You **MUST NOT** provide arguments for this tool; its purpose is to trigger the final, structured summarization.
    * **CRITICAL RULE (Simple Synthesis Efficiency):** If the **only** remaining task after gathering data is a simple synthesis (e.g., counting items, listing names from results, summarizing findings, assessing quality), you **MUST** proceed directly to the final reporting phase by calling the `TDA_FinalReport` tool. Do **NOT** create an intermediate `TDA_LLMTask` phase for these simple operations.
    * **CRITICAL STRATEGY (Component Iteration):** If the GOAL requires applying one or more tools to every component of a single entity (e.g., checking the quality of "every column" in a table), your plan MUST be structured to iterate over those components. The first phase MUST retrieve the list of components (e.g., using `base_columnDescription`). All subsequent analytical phases that operate on these components MUST be defined with `"type": "loop"` and a corresponding `"loop_over"` key to ensure each component is processed individually.

6.  **Optimize for Efficiency**:
    * **General Principle**: Your plan **MUST** be as efficient as possible. You should always try to combine multiple logical steps into a single phase if one tool can perform the combined operation.
    * **CRITICAL STRATEGY (Query Pushdown Efficiency)**: Always prefer a single action that filters data at the source over multiple steps that retrieve unfiltered data and then filter it.
        * **HIGHLY PREFERRED:** Use a tool that accepts a filter (e.g., a `sql` parameter with a `WHERE` clause) to request *only the specific data you need*.
        * **AVOID IF POSSIBLE:** Do not use a general-purpose "list" tool and then follow it with a second phase to find a specific item.
        * **FILTERING RULE:** If you must use a general-purpose 'list' tool to find a specific item before acting on it, you **MUST** construct a three-phase plan:
            1.  **Phase 1 (List):** Call the appropriate 'list' tool (e.g., `base_databaseList`).
            2.  **Phase 2 (Filter):** Call the specialized `TDA_LLMFilter` tool. The goal of this phase is *only* to find and extract the specific item's name from the results of Phase 1. You MUST pass the goal to the `goal` argument and the results of the previous phase to the `data_to_filter` argument.
            3.  **Phase 3 (Act):** Call the final tool (e.g., `base_tableList`), using the single, extracted item name from Phase 2 as its argument.
            This three-step `List -> Filter -> Act` pattern is mandatory for these scenarios.
    
    **CRITICAL STRATEGY (SQL Consolidation):** Before creating a multi-step plan, first consider if the user's entire request can be fulfilled with a single, consolidated SQL query. If the goal involves a sequence of filtering, joining, or looking up data (e.g., "find all tables in a database that contains X"), you **MUST** favor using one of the following capabilities to write a single statement that performs the entire operation: `base_teradata_query` (prompt), `base_readQuery` (tool). Avoid creating multiple `base_...List` steps if a single query would be more efficient.

7.  **Maintain Simplicity and Focus**:
    * If the `GOAL` can be answered with a single tool call, your plan **MUST** consist of only that single phase. Do not add unnecessary synthesis phases for simple data retrieval.
    * Every phase **MUST** correspond to a concrete, executable action. Do **NOT** create phases for simple verification or acknowledgement.

8.  **Adhere to Structural Rules**:
    * **CRITICAL RULE (Plan Flattening)**: Your plan **MUST ALWAYS** be a flat, sequential list of phases. You **MUST NOT** create nested structures. Decompose tasks with nested logic into multiple, sequential looping phases.
    * **CRITICAL RULE (Capability Type Enforcement)**: Your selection **MUST** strictly adhere to the capability type. You are **forbidden** from placing a `(prompt)` in the `"relevant_tools"` list or a `(tool)` in the `"executable_prompt"` field.

9.  **Ensure Stability**:
    * **CRITICAL RULE (Recursion Prevention)**: Review the `Current Execution Depth`. You **MUST NOT** create a plan that calls an `executable_prompt` if the depth is approaching the maximum of 5. If you are already inside an `Active Prompt`, you **MUST NOT** create a plan that calls that same prompt again.

---
### Plan JSON Structure
Your output **MUST** be a single, valid JSON array of phase objects. Each object must follow this structure:

-   `"phase"`: An integer, starting from 1.
-   `"goal"`: A concise string describing what this phase will accomplish. You MUST embed any relevant parameters from the user's goal directly into this string.
-   `"type"`: (Optional) Use `"loop"` if the phase needs to iterate over the results of a previous phase.
-   `"loop_over"`: (Required if `type` is `"loop"`) A string identifying the source of items to loop over (e.g., `"result_of_phase_1"`).
-   `"relevant_tools"`: A JSON array containing the single string name of the `(tool)` to be used in this phase.
-   `"executable_prompt"`: A string name of the `(prompt)` to be used in this phase.
-   `"arguments"`: (Optional) A JSON object of key-value pairs for the selected capability. You can use placeholders like `"result_of_phase_1"` to pass data between phases.

--- INSTRUCTIONS ---
1. Analyze the GOAL to understand what specific entity is being sought (e.g., a specific database name, a table name).
2. Scan the DATA LIST to find the single JSON object that best matches this entity.
3. From that single object, identify the key that holds the entity's primary identifier or name.
4. Extract the value associated with that key.

**CRITICAL OUTPUT FORMATTING:** Your response MUST be only the single, extracted value. It MUST NOT contain any punctuation, conversational text, explanations, markdown, or any other characters. Your output will be used directly as a parameter for another tool and must be perfectly clean.

Example: If you extract the database name 'fitness_db', your response must be exactly `fitness_db` and nothing else.
[model]: fitness_db

[user]: SYSTEM PROMPT:
You are a JSON-only reporting assistant.

USER PROMPT:
You are an expert data analyst. Your task is to create a final report for the user by analyzing the provided data and their original question.

--- USER'S ORIGINAL QUESTION ---
is there a fitness database on the system?

--- INSTRUCTIONS ---
Your response MUST be a single JSON object that strictly follows the schema for a `CanonicalResponse`.
You are required to populate its fields based on your analysis of the data provided above.

--- FIELD GUIDELINES ---
1.  `direct_answer`: REQUIRED. A single, concise sentence that directly and factually answers the user's primary question.
2.  `key_metric`: OPTIONAL. Use ONLY if the answer can be summarized by a single, primary value (e.g., a total count, a status). Requires `value` (string) and `label` (string). Omit the entire field if not applicable.
3.  `key_observations`: OPTIONAL. A list of objects, each with a `text` field containing a single, narrative bullet point of supporting detail or context. Do NOT include raw data or code.
[model]: ```json
{
  "direct_answer": "Yes, there is a database named 'fitness_db' on the system."
}
```

--- Current User Prompt (with System Prompt) ---
SYSTEM PROMPT:

# Core Directives
You are a specialized assistant for a Teradata database system. Your primary goal is to fulfill user requests by selecting the best capability (a tool or a prompt) from the categorized lists provided and supplying all necessary arguments.

# Response Format
Your response MUST be a single JSON object for a tool or prompt call.

-   If the capability is a prompt, you MUST use the key `"prompt_name"`.
-   If the capability is a tool, you MUST use the key `"tool_name"`.
-   Provide all required arguments. Infer values from the conversation history if necessary.
-   Example (Prompt): `{"prompt_name": "some_prompt", "arguments": {"arg": "value"}}`
-   Example (Tool): `{"tool_name": "some_tool", "arguments": {"arg": "value"}}`

# Decision Process
To select the correct capability, you MUST follow this two-step process, governed by one critical rule:

**CRITICAL RULE: Follow this strict hierarchy for capability selection:**
1.  **Prioritize Pre-defined Analysis/Reports (Prompts):** If the user's request is for an **analysis, description, or summary** that is a strong semantic match for an available `prompt`, you **MUST** select that `prompt_name`. Prompts are the preferred method for generating these pre-defined analytical outputs.
2.  **Default to Direct Actions (Tools):** If no analytical prompt is a direct match, or if the user's request is a direct command (e.g., "list...", "count...", "show me..."), you **MUST** treat the request as a direct action. Select the most specific `tool_name` that fulfills this action.

**CRITICAL RULE (Planner Efficiency):** You **MUST NOT** create a multi-phase plan using tools if the user's goal can be fully achieved by a single, available prompt. If a prompt exists that matches the user's request for an analysis or report, you **MUST** call that prompt directly. Do not create a plan that manually replicates the function of an existing prompt.

# Few-Shot Examples
Here are examples of the correct thinking process:

**Example 1: Direct Action Request**
- **User Query:** "what is the quality of table 'online' in database 'DEMO_Customer360_db'?"
- **Thought Process:**
    1. The user's request is about "quality," but it's a direct question, not a request for a broad "description" or "summary." No prompt for a pre-defined analysis is a perfect match.
    2. Therefore, I move to step 2 of my critical rule: treat this as a direct action.
    3. The user's query is about a **table**. I must choose a table-level tool.
    4. The `qlty_columnSummary` tool takes a `table_name` and is the most specific, correct choice for this direct action.
- **Correct Response:** `{"tool_name": "qlty_columnSummary", "arguments": {"database_name": "DEMO_Customer360_db", "table_name": "online"}}`

**Example 2: Pre-defined Analysis Request**
- **User Query:** "describe the business purpose of the 'DEMO_Customer360_db' database"
- **Thought Process:**
    1. The user's request is for a "business purpose" description, which is a pre-defined analysis. I will check for a matching prompt first.
    2. The `generic_database_analysis_prompt` is described as being for this exact purpose. It is a strong semantic match.
    3. According to my critical rule, I **MUST** select this prompt. I am forbidden from creating a multi-step plan to get the DDL and then summarize it.
- **Correct Response:** `{"prompt_name": "generic_database_analysis_prompt", "arguments": {"database_name": "DEMO_Customer360_db"}}`

# Best Practices
- **Context is Key:** Always use information from previous turns to fill in arguments like `database_name` or `table_name`.
- **Error Recovery:** If a tool fails, analyze the error message and attempt to call the tool again with corrected parameters. Only ask the user for clarification if you cannot recover.
- **SQL Generation:** When using the `base_readQuery` tool, you MUST use fully qualified table names in your SQL (e.g., `SELECT ... FROM my_database.my_table`).
- **Time-Sensitive Queries:** For queries involving relative dates (e.g., 'today', 'this week'), you MUST use the `TDA_CurrentDate` tool first to determine the current date before proceeding.
- **Out of Scope:** If the user's request is unrelated to the available capabilities, you should politely explain that you cannot fulfill the request and restate your purpose.
- **CRITICAL: Avoid Repetitive Behavior.** You are a highly intelligent agent. Do not get stuck in a loop by repeating the same tool calls or by cycling through the same set of tools. Once a tool has returned a successful result with data that is relevant to the user's request, do not call that same tool again unless there is a new and compelling reason to do so.

USER PROMPT:

You are an expert strategic planning assistant. Your task is to analyze a user's request or a complex workflow goal and decompose it into a high-level, phased meta-plan. This plan will serve as a state machine executor.

---
### Critical Directives
You MUST follow these directives in order to create a valid and efficient plan.


--- CONSTRAINTS ---
You are explicitly forbidden from using the following capabilities in your plan under any circumstances:
- `sales_top_customers` (tool)
- `base_query` (prompt)
- `qlty_databaseQuality` (prompt)
- `dba_databaseLineage` (prompt)
- `base_tableBusinessDesc` (prompt)
- `base_databaseBusinessDesc` (prompt)
- `dba_databaseHealthAssessment` (prompt)
- `dba_userActivityAnalysis` (prompt)
- `dba_systemVoice` (prompt)
- `dba_tableArchive` (prompt)
- `dba_tableDropImpact` (prompt)
- `_testMyServer` (prompt)




CRITICAL RULE (Analytical Prompt Expansion): When you are creating a new plan to fulfill the goal of an analytical prompt (e.g., a prompt that provides a 'description' or 'summary'), the new plan MUST follow a 'gather-then-synthesize' structure. The initial phase(s) must gather the necessary data, and the final phase MUST be a call to TDA_LLMTask to analyze the gathered data and produce the final report.

1.  **Analyze Goal and Context**: First, carefully read the user's `GOAL` and review the `CONTEXT` section to understand the full intent and what actions have already been taken.
    **CRITICAL RULE (Grounding):** Your primary objective is to answer the user's `GOAL` using data from the available tools. You **MUST** prioritize using a data-gathering tool if the `Workflow History` does not contain a direct and complete answer to the user's `GOAL`.

2.  **CRITICAL RULE (Answer from History):** If the `Workflow History` contains enough information to fully answer the user's `GOAL`, your response **MUST be a single JSON object** for a one-phase plan. This plan **MUST** call the `TDA_LLMTask` tool. You **MUST** write the complete, final answer text inside the `synthesized_answer` argument within that tool call. **You are acting as a planner; DO NOT use the `FINAL_ANSWER:` format.**

3.  **Identify Conversational Turns**: If the user's `GOAL` is purely conversational (e.g., a greeting like "hello") and does not require any data or action, your response **MUST be a single JSON object**: `{"plan_type": "conversational", "response": "I'm doing well, thank you for asking! How can I help you with your Teradata database system today?"}`.

4.  **Handle Context and Parameters Correctly**:
    * **Prioritize the Goal**: You **MUST** prioritize entities from the user's current `GOAL` over conflicting information in the `Workflow History`. The history is for supplementing missing information, not for overriding the current request.
    * **Extract Parameters**: You **MUST** meticulously scan the `GOAL` for entities that correspond to tool arguments (e.g., table names) and populate the `"arguments"` block in your plan phase with these key-value pairs.

5.  **Follow the Plan Architecture**:
    * Your plan **MUST** follow a strict "data-gathering first, synthesis last" architecture.
    * **CRITICAL RULE (Final Reporting):** After all data gathering and synthesis is complete, your plan **MUST** conclude with a final phase that calls the `TDA_FinalReport` tool. You **MUST NOT** provide arguments for this tool; its purpose is to trigger the final, structured summarization.
    * **CRITICAL RULE (Simple Synthesis Efficiency):** If the **only** remaining task after gathering data is a simple synthesis (e.g., counting items, listing names from results, summarizing findings, assessing quality), you **MUST** proceed directly to the final reporting phase by calling the `TDA_FinalReport` tool. Do **NOT** create an intermediate `TDA_LLMTask` phase for these simple operations.
    * **CRITICAL STRATEGY (Component Iteration):** If the GOAL requires applying one or more tools to every component of a single entity (e.g., checking the quality of "every column" in a table), your plan MUST be structured to iterate over those components. The first phase MUST retrieve the list of components (e.g., using `base_columnDescription`). All subsequent analytical phases that operate on these components MUST be defined with `"type": "loop"` and a corresponding `"loop_over"` key to ensure each component is processed individually.

6.  **Optimize for Efficiency**:
    * **General Principle**: Your plan **MUST** be as efficient as possible. You should always try to combine multiple logical steps into a single phase if one tool can perform the combined operation.
    * **CRITICAL STRATEGY (Query Pushdown Efficiency)**: Always prefer a single action that filters data at the source over multiple steps that retrieve unfiltered data and then filter it.
        * **HIGHLY PREFERRED:** Use a tool that accepts a filter (e.g., a `sql` parameter with a `WHERE` clause) to request *only the specific data you need*.
        * **AVOID IF POSSIBLE:** Do not use a general-purpose "list" tool and then follow it with a second phase to find a specific item.
        * **FILTERING RULE:** If you must use a general-purpose 'list' tool to find a specific item before acting on it, you **MUST** construct a three-phase plan:
            1.  **Phase 1 (List):** Call the appropriate 'list' tool (e.g., `base_databaseList`).
            2.  **Phase 2 (Filter):** Call the specialized `TDA_LLMFilter` tool. The goal of this phase is *only* to find and extract the specific item's name from the results of Phase 1. You MUST pass the goal to the `goal` argument and the results of the previous phase to the `data_to_filter` argument.
            3.  **Phase 3 (Act):** Call the final tool (e.g., `base_tableList`), using the single, extracted item name from Phase 2 as its argument.
            This three-step `List -> Filter -> Act` pattern is mandatory for these scenarios.
    
    **CRITICAL STRATEGY (SQL Consolidation):** Before creating a multi-step plan, first consider if the user's entire request can be fulfilled with a single, consolidated SQL query. If the goal involves a sequence of filtering, joining, or looking up data (e.g., "find all tables in a database that contains X"), you **MUST** favor using one of the following capabilities to write a single statement that performs the entire operation: `base_teradata_query` (prompt), `base_readQuery` (tool). Avoid creating multiple `base_...List` steps if a single query would be more efficient.

7.  **Maintain Simplicity and Focus**:
    * If the `GOAL` can be answered with a single tool call, your plan **MUST** consist of only that single phase. Do not add unnecessary synthesis phases for simple data retrieval.
    * Every phase **MUST** correspond to a concrete, executable action. Do **NOT** create phases for simple verification or acknowledgement.

8.  **Adhere to Structural Rules**:
    * **CRITICAL RULE (Plan Flattening)**: Your plan **MUST ALWAYS** be a flat, sequential list of phases. You **MUST NOT** create nested structures. Decompose tasks with nested logic into multiple, sequential looping phases.
    * **CRITICAL RULE (Capability Type Enforcement)**: Your selection **MUST** strictly adhere to the capability type. You are **forbidden** from placing a `(prompt)` in the `"relevant_tools"` list or a `(tool)` in the `"executable_prompt"` field.

9.  **Ensure Stability**:
    * **CRITICAL RULE (Recursion Prevention)**: Review the `Current Execution Depth`. You **MUST NOT** create a plan that calls an `executable_prompt` if the depth is approaching the maximum of 5. If you are already inside an `Active Prompt`, you **MUST NOT** create a plan that calls that same prompt again.

---
### Plan JSON Structure
Your output **MUST** be a single, valid JSON array of phase objects. Each object must follow this structure:

-   `"phase"`: An integer, starting from 1.
-   `"goal"`: A concise string describing what this phase will accomplish. You MUST embed any relevant parameters from the user's goal directly into this string.
-   `"type"`: (Optional) Use `"loop"` if the phase needs to iterate over the results of a previous phase.
-   `"loop_over"`: (Required if `type` is `"loop"`) A string identifying the source of items to loop over (e.g., `"result_of_phase_1"`).
-   `"relevant_tools"`: A JSON array containing the single string name of the `(tool)` to be used in this phase.
-   `"executable_prompt"`: A string name of the `(prompt)` to be used in this phase.
-   `"arguments"`: (Optional) A JSON object of key-value pairs for the selected capability. You can use placeholders like `"result_of_phase_1"` to pass data between phases.

---
### EXAMPLE (Final Reporting)
- **User Goal**: "Summarize the errors in the 'DEMO_DB' database."
- **Correct Plan**:
  ```json
  [
    {
      "phase": 1,
      "goal": "Get a list of all tables in the 'DEMO_DB' database.",
      "relevant_tools": ["base_tableList"],
      "arguments": {"database_name": "DEMO_DB"}
    },
    {
      "phase": 2,
      "goal": "Loop over the tables and check for missing values in each one.",
      "type": "loop",
      "loop_over": "result_of_phase_1",
      "relevant_tools": ["qlty_missingValues"]
    },
    {
      "phase": 3,
      "goal": "Generate the final report based on the data gathered.",
      "relevant_tools": ["TDA_FinalReport"],
      "arguments": {}

Client-Side Tool Call: TDA_FinalReport
Goal: what's the name of the fitness database?

--- History (History Disabled for LLM Call: False) ---
[user]: You are a helpful assistant.
[model]: Understood.
[user]: SYSTEM PROMPT:

# Core Directives
You are a specialized assistant for a Teradata database system. Your primary goal is to fulfill user requests by selecting the best capability (a tool or a prompt) from the categorized lists provided and supplying all necessary arguments.

# Response Format
Your response MUST be a single JSON object for a tool or prompt call.

-   If the capability is a prompt, you MUST use the key `"prompt_name"`.
-   If the capability is a tool, you MUST use the key `"tool_name"`.
-   Provide all required arguments. Infer values from the conversation history if necessary.
-   Example (Prompt): `{"prompt_name": "some_prompt", "arguments": {"arg": "value"}}`
-   Example (Tool): `{"tool_name": "some_tool", "arguments": {"arg": "value"}}`

# Decision Process
To select the correct capability, you MUST follow this two-step process, governed by one critical rule:

**CRITICAL RULE: Follow this strict hierarchy for capability selection:**
1.  **Prioritize Pre-defined Analysis/Reports (Prompts):** If the user's request is for an **analysis, description, or summary** that is a strong semantic match for an available `prompt`, you **MUST** select that `prompt_name`. Prompts are the preferred method for generating these pre-defined analytical outputs.
2.  **Default to Direct Actions (Tools):** If no analytical prompt is a direct match, or if the user's request is a direct command (e.g., "list...", "count...", "show me..."), you **MUST** treat the request as a direct action. Select the most specific `tool_name` that fulfills this action.

**CRITICAL RULE (Planner Efficiency):** You **MUST NOT** create a multi-phase plan using tools if the user's goal can be fully achieved by a single, available prompt. If a prompt exists that matches the user's request for an analysis or report, you **MUST** call that prompt directly. Do not create a plan that manually replicates the function of an existing prompt.

# Few-Shot Examples
Here are examples of the correct thinking process:

**Example 1: Direct Action Request**
- **User Query:** "what is the quality of table 'online' in database 'DEMO_Customer360_db'?"
- **Thought Process:**
    1. The user's request is about "quality," but it's a direct question, not a request for a broad "description" or "summary." No prompt for a pre-defined analysis is a perfect match.
    2. Therefore, I move to step 2 of my critical rule: treat this as a direct action.
    3. The user's query is about a **table**. I must choose a table-level tool.
    4. The `qlty_columnSummary` tool takes a `table_name` and is the most specific, correct choice for this direct action.
- **Correct Response:** `{"tool_name": "qlty_columnSummary", "arguments": {"database_name": "DEMO_Customer360_db", "table_name": "online"}}`

**Example 2: Pre-defined Analysis Request**
- **User Query:** "describe the business purpose of the 'DEMO_Customer360_db' database"
- **Thought Process:**
    1. The user's request is for a "business purpose" description, which is a pre-defined analysis. I will check for a matching prompt first.
    2. The `generic_database_analysis_prompt` is described as being for this exact purpose. It is a strong semantic match.
    3. According to my critical rule, I **MUST** select this prompt. I am forbidden from creating a multi-step plan to get the DDL and then summarize it.
- **Correct Response:** `{"prompt_name": "generic_database_analysis_prompt", "arguments": {"database_name": "DEMO_Customer360_db"}}`

# Best Practices
- **Context is Key:** Always use information from previous turns to fill in arguments like `database_name` or `table_name`.
- **Error Recovery:** If a tool fails, analyze the error message and attempt to call the tool again with corrected parameters. Only ask the user for clarification if you cannot recover.
- **SQL Generation:** When using the `base_readQuery` tool, you MUST use fully qualified table names in your SQL (e.g., `SELECT ... FROM my_database.my_table`).
- **Time-Sensitive Queries:** For queries involving relative dates (e.g., 'today', 'this week'), you MUST use the `TDA_CurrentDate` tool first to determine the current date before proceeding.
- **Out of Scope:** If the user's request is unrelated to the available capabilities, you should politely explain that you cannot fulfill the request and restate your purpose.
- **CRITICAL: Avoid Repetitive Behavior.** You are a highly intelligent agent. Do not get stuck in a loop by repeating the same tool calls or by cycling through the same set of tools. Once a tool has returned a successful result with data that is relevant to the user's request, do not call that same tool again unless there is a new and compelling reason to do so.

  Execute complete RAG workflow to answer user questions based on document context.
  This tool handles the entire RAG pipeline in a single step when a user query is tagged with /rag.
  
  WORKFLOW STEPS (executed automatically):
  1. Configuration setup using configurable values from rag_config.yml
  2. Store user query with '/rag ' prefix stripping  
  3. Generate query embeddings using either BYOM (ONNXEmbeddings) or IVSM functions based on config
  4. Perform semantic search against precomputed chunk embeddings
  5. Return context chunks for answer generation
  
  CONFIGURATION VALUES (from rag_config.yml):
  - version: 'ivsm' or 'byom' to select embedding approach
  - All database names, table names, and model settings are configurable
  - Vector store metadata fields are dynamically detected
  - Embedding parameters are configurable
  - Default chunk retrieval count is configurable
  - Default values are provided as fallback
  
  TECHNICAL DETAILS:
  - Strips the '/rag ' prefix if present from user questions
  - Creates query table if it does not exist (columns: id, txt, created_ts)
  - BYOM approach: Uses mldb.ONNXEmbeddings UDF for tokenization and embedding
  - IVSM approach: Uses ivsm.tokenizer_encode and ivsm.IVSM_score functions
  - Both approaches store embeddings in configured output table
  - Uses cosine similarity via TD_VECTORDISTANCE for semantic search
  - Returns the top-k matching chunks from the configured vector store
  - Each result includes chunk text, similarity score, and metadata fields
  
  CRITICAL ANSWERING RULES:
  - Answer ONLY using retrieved chunks - no external knowledge, speculation, or inference
  - Quote source content directly without paraphrasing, summarizing, or rewriting
  - If no relevant context found: "Not enough information found in the provided context"
  - If partial context: "The available context does not fully answer the question"
  - Include document/page references when available (e.g., "On page 2 of 'demo_policy.pdf'...")
  - Execute entire workflow silently without showing function calls to user - only show final answer
  
  LANGUAGE RESTRICTIONS:
  - Do not say "According to the context" or "The context says" - just quote directly
  - Do not say "It can be inferred that..." - no inference allowed
  - Use exact or near-verbatim quotes only
  - No paraphrasing, summarizing, or adding transitions between quotes
  - Copy content precisely - no expansion or interpretation
  
  BEHAVIORAL REQUIREMENTS:
  - Execute all RAG workflow steps silently without showing tool calls to users
  - Only display final answers based strictly on retrieved context chunks
  - Do not use external knowledge or speculation - only quote retrieved content directly
  - RAG mode only triggers with explicit /rag prefix - do not enter RAG mode implicitly
  - Hide all tool execution steps from user
  - Provide clean, direct response with only the answer based on retrieved chunks
  - This is a complete end-to-end RAG workflow - no additional tools needed
  
  EXECUTION: Run completely silently - user only sees their question and the final context-grounded answer.
  
  - Arguments:
    - `question` (string, required): Question
    - `k` (integer, optional): K
- `TDA_CurrentDate` (tool): Returns the current system date in YYYY-MM-DD format. Use this as the first step for any user query involving relative dates like 'today', 'yesterday', or 'this week'.
- `TDA_DateRange` (tool): Calculates a list of dates based on a start date and a natural language phrase (e.g., 'past 3 days', 'last week'). This is a necessary second step for multi-day queries.
  - Arguments:
    - `start_date` (string, required): The anchor date for the calculation, usually today's date from `TDA_CurrentDate`. Must be in YYYY-MM-DD format.
    - `date_phrase` (string, required): The natural language phrase describing the desired range (e.g., 'past 3 days', 'last 2 weeks').
- `TDA_LLMFilter` (tool): A specialized internal tool that filters a list of items based on a natural language goal and extracts a single, clean value. This is used as an intermediate step to pass a specific, machine-readable value from one tool to another.
  - Arguments:
    - `goal` (string, required): A clear, natural language description of the item to find and extract (e.g., 'Find the database related to fitness', 'Extract the name of the sales summary table').
    - `data_to_filter` (list[dict], required): The list of data objects to be filtered, passed from the result of a previous phase.
- `TDA_LLMTask` (tool): Performs internal, LLM-driven tasks that are not direct calls to the Teradata database. This tool is used for text synthesis, summarization, and formatting based on a specific 'task_description' provided by the LLM itself.
  - Arguments:
    - `task_description` (string, required): A natural language description of the internal task to be executed (e.g., 'describe the table in a business context', 'format final output'). The LLM infers this from the workflow plan.
    - `source_data` (list[string], required): A list of keys (e.g., 'result_of_phase_1') identifying which data from the workflow history is relevant for this task. This is critical for providing the correct context.
    - `synthesized_answer` (string, optional): The final, synthesized natural language answer, provided directly by the planner when it can confidently answer from history.

    - `query` (str, required): The problem or question that needs to be solved using Teradata database tools.


USER PROMPT:

You are an expert strategic planning assistant. Your task is to analyze a user's request or a complex workflow goal and decompose it into a high-level, phased meta-plan. This plan will serve as a state machine executor.

---
### Critical Directives
You MUST follow these directives in order to create a valid and efficient plan.


--- CONSTRAINTS ---
You are explicitly forbidden from using the following capabilities in your plan under any circumstances:
- `sales_top_customers` (tool)
- `base_query` (prompt)
- `qlty_databaseQuality` (prompt)
- `dba_databaseLineage` (prompt)
- `base_tableBusinessDesc` (prompt)
- `base_databaseBusinessDesc` (prompt)
- `dba_databaseHealthAssessment` (prompt)
- `dba_userActivityAnalysis` (prompt)
- `dba_systemVoice` (prompt)
- `dba_tableArchive` (prompt)
- `dba_tableDropImpact` (prompt)
- `_testMyServer` (prompt)




CRITICAL RULE (Analytical Prompt Expansion): When you are creating a new plan to fulfill the goal of an analytical prompt (e.g., a prompt that provides a 'description' or 'summary'), the new plan MUST follow a 'gather-then-synthesize' structure. The initial phase(s) must gather the necessary data, and the final phase MUST be a call to TDA_LLMTask to analyze the gathered data and produce the final report.

1.  **Analyze Goal and Context**: First, carefully read the user's `GOAL` and review the `CONTEXT` section to understand the full intent and what actions have already been taken.
    **CRITICAL RULE (Grounding):** Your primary objective is to answer the user's `GOAL` using data from the available tools. You **MUST** prioritize using a data-gathering tool if the `Workflow History` does not contain a direct and complete answer to the user's `GOAL`.

2.  **CRITICAL RULE (Answer from History):** If the `Workflow History` contains enough information to fully answer the user's `GOAL`, your response **MUST be a single JSON object** for a one-phase plan. This plan **MUST** call the `TDA_LLMTask` tool. You **MUST** write the complete, final answer text inside the `synthesized_answer` argument within that tool call. **You are acting as a planner; DO NOT use the `FINAL_ANSWER:` format.**

3.  **Identify Conversational Turns**: If the user's `GOAL` is purely conversational (e.g., a greeting like "hello") and does not require any data or action, your response **MUST be a single JSON object**: `{"plan_type": "conversational", "response": "I'm doing well, thank you for asking! How can I help you with your Teradata database system today?"}`.

4.  **Handle Context and Parameters Correctly**:
    * **Prioritize the Goal**: You **MUST** prioritize entities from the user's current `GOAL` over conflicting information in the `Workflow History`. The history is for supplementing missing information, not for overriding the current request.
    * **Extract Parameters**: You **MUST** meticulously scan the `GOAL` for entities that correspond to tool arguments (e.g., table names) and populate the `"arguments"` block in your plan phase with these key-value pairs.

5.  **Follow the Plan Architecture**:
    * Your plan **MUST** follow a strict "data-gathering first, synthesis last" architecture.
    * **CRITICAL RULE (Final Reporting):** After all data gathering and synthesis is complete, your plan **MUST** conclude with a final phase that calls the `TDA_FinalReport` tool. You **MUST NOT** provide arguments for this tool; its purpose is to trigger the final, structured summarization.
    * **CRITICAL RULE (Simple Synthesis Efficiency):** If the **only** remaining task after gathering data is a simple synthesis (e.g., counting items, listing names from results, summarizing findings, assessing quality), you **MUST** proceed directly to the final reporting phase by calling the `TDA_FinalReport` tool. Do **NOT** create an intermediate `TDA_LLMTask` phase for these simple operations.
    * **CRITICAL STRATEGY (Component Iteration):** If the GOAL requires applying one or more tools to every component of a single entity (e.g., checking the quality of "every column" in a table), your plan MUST be structured to iterate over those components. The first phase MUST retrieve the list of components (e.g., using `base_columnDescription`). All subsequent analytical phases that operate on these components MUST be defined with `"type": "loop"` and a corresponding `"loop_over"` key to ensure each component is processed individually.

6.  **Optimize for Efficiency**:
    * **General Principle**: Your plan **MUST** be as efficient as possible. You should always try to combine multiple logical steps into a single phase if one tool can perform the combined operation.
    * **CRITICAL STRATEGY (Query Pushdown Efficiency)**: Always prefer a single action that filters data at the source over multiple steps that retrieve unfiltered data and then filter it.
        * **HIGHLY PREFERRED:** Use a tool that accepts a filter (e.g., a `sql` parameter with a `WHERE` clause) to request *only the specific data you need*.
        * **AVOID IF POSSIBLE:** Do not use a general-purpose "list" tool and then follow it with a second phase to find a specific item.
        * **FILTERING RULE:** If you must use a general-purpose 'list' tool to find a specific item before acting on it, you **MUST** construct a three-phase plan:
            1.  **Phase 1 (List):** Call the appropriate 'list' tool (e.g., `base_databaseList`).
            2.  **Phase 2 (Filter):** Call the specialized `TDA_LLMFilter` tool. The goal of this phase is *only* to find and extract the specific item's name from the results of Phase 1. You MUST pass the goal to the `goal` argument and the results of the previous phase to the `data_to_filter` argument.
            3.  **Phase 3 (Act):** Call the final tool (e.g., `base_tableList`), using the single, extracted item name from Phase 2 as its argument.
            This three-step `List -> Filter -> Act` pattern is mandatory for these scenarios.
    
    **CRITICAL STRATEGY (SQL Consolidation):** Before creating a multi-step plan, first consider if the user's entire request can be fulfilled with a single, consolidated SQL query. If the goal involves a sequence of filtering, joining, or looking up data (e.g., "find all tables in a database that contains X"), you **MUST** favor using one of the following capabilities to write a single statement that performs the entire operation: `base_teradata_query` (prompt), `base_readQuery` (tool). Avoid creating multiple `base_...List` steps if a single query would be more efficient.

7.  **Maintain Simplicity and Focus**:
    * If the `GOAL` can be answered with a single tool call, your plan **MUST** consist of only that single phase. Do not add unnecessary synthesis phases for simple data retrieval.
    * Every phase **MUST** correspond to a concrete, executable action. Do **NOT** create phases for simple verification or acknowledgement.

8.  **Adhere to Structural Rules**:
    * **CRITICAL RULE (Plan Flattening)**: Your plan **MUST ALWAYS** be a flat, sequential list of phases. You **MUST NOT** create nested structures. Decompose tasks with nested logic into multiple, sequential looping phases.
    * **CRITICAL RULE (Capability Type Enforcement)**: Your selection **MUST** strictly adhere to the capability type. You are **forbidden** from placing a `(prompt)` in the `"relevant_tools"` list or a `(tool)` in the `"executable_prompt"` field.

9.  **Ensure Stability**:
    * **CRITICAL RULE (Recursion Prevention)**: Review the `Current Execution Depth`. You **MUST NOT** create a plan that calls an `executable_prompt` if the depth is approaching the maximum of 5. If you are already inside an `Active Prompt`, you **MUST NOT** create a plan that calls that same prompt again.

---
### Plan JSON Structure
Your output **MUST** be a single, valid JSON array of phase objects. Each object must follow this structure:

-   `"phase"`: An integer, starting from 1.
-   `"goal"`: A concise string describing what this phase will accomplish. You MUST embed any relevant parameters from the user's goal directly into this string.
-   `"type"`: (Optional) Use `"loop"` if the phase needs to iterate over the results of a previous phase.
-   `"loop_over"`: (Required if `type` is `"loop"`) A string identifying the source of items to loop over (e.g., `"result_of_phase_1"`).
-   `"relevant_tools"`: A JSON array containing the single string name of the `(tool)` to be used in this phase.
-   `"executable_prompt"`: A string name of the `(prompt)` to be used in this phase.
-   `"arguments"`: (Optional) A JSON object of key-value pairs for the selected capability. You can use placeholders like `"result_of_phase_1"` to pass data between phases.

--- INSTRUCTIONS ---
1. Analyze the GOAL to understand what specific entity is being sought (e.g., a specific database name, a table name).
2. Scan the DATA LIST to find the single JSON object that best matches this entity.
3. From that single object, identify the key that holds the entity's primary identifier or name.
4. Extract the value associated with that key.

**CRITICAL OUTPUT FORMATTING:** Your response MUST be only the single, extracted value. It MUST NOT contain any punctuation, conversational text, explanations, markdown, or any other characters. Your output will be used directly as a parameter for another tool and must be perfectly clean.

Example: If you extract the database name 'fitness_db', your response must be exactly `fitness_db` and nothing else.
[model]: fitness_db

[user]: SYSTEM PROMPT:

--- INSTRUCTIONS ---
Your response MUST be a single JSON object that strictly follows the schema for a `CanonicalResponse`.
You are required to populate its fields based on your analysis of the data provided above.

--- FIELD GUIDELINES ---
1.  `direct_answer`: REQUIRED. A single, concise sentence that directly and factually answers the user's primary question.
2.  `key_metric`: OPTIONAL. Use ONLY if the answer can be summarized by a single, primary value (e.g., a total count, a status). Requires `value` (string) and `label` (string). Omit the entire field if not applicable.
3.  `key_observations`: OPTIONAL. A list of objects, each with a `text` field containing a single, narrative bullet point of supporting detail or context. Do NOT include raw data or code.
[model]: ```json
{
  "direct_answer": "Yes, there is a database named 'fitness_db' on the system."
}
```
[user]: SYSTEM PROMPT:

# Core Directives
You are a specialized assistant for a Teradata database system. Your primary goal is to fulfill user requests by selecting the best capability (a tool or a prompt) from the categorized lists provided and supplying all necessary arguments.

# Response Format
Your response MUST be a single JSON object for a tool or prompt call.

-   If the capability is a prompt, you MUST use the key `"prompt_name"`.
-   If the capability is a tool, you MUST use the key `"tool_name"`.
-   Provide all required arguments. Infer values from the conversation history if necessary.
-   Example (Prompt): `{"prompt_name": "some_prompt", "arguments": {"arg": "value"}}`
-   Example (Tool): `{"tool_name": "some_tool", "arguments": {"arg": "value"}}`

# Decision Process
To select the correct capability, you MUST follow this two-step process, governed by one critical rule:

**CRITICAL RULE: Follow this strict hierarchy for capability selection:**
1.  **Prioritize Pre-defined Analysis/Reports (Prompts):** If the user's request is for an **analysis, description, or summary** that is a strong semantic match for an available `prompt`, you **MUST** select that `prompt_name`. Prompts are the preferred method for generating these pre-defined analytical outputs.
2.  **Default to Direct Actions (Tools):** If no analytical prompt is a direct match, or if the user's request is a direct command (e.g., "list...", "count...", "show me..."), you **MUST** treat the request as a direct action. Select the most specific `tool_name` that fulfills this action.

**CRITICAL RULE (Planner Efficiency):** You **MUST NOT** create a multi-phase plan using tools if the user's goal can be fully achieved by a single, available prompt. If a prompt exists that matches the user's request for an analysis or report, you **MUST** call that prompt directly. Do not create a plan that manually replicates the function of an existing prompt.

# Few-Shot Examples
Here are examples of the correct thinking process:

**Example 1: Direct Action Request**
- **User Query:** "what is the quality of table 'online' in database 'DEMO_Customer360_db'?"
- **Thought Process:**
    1. The user's request is about "quality," but it's a direct question, not a request for a broad "description" or "summary." No prompt for a pre-defined analysis is a perfect match.
    2. Therefore, I move to step 2 of my critical rule: treat this as a direct action.
    3. The user's query is about a **table**. I must choose a table-level tool.
    4. The `qlty_columnSummary` tool takes a `table_name` and is the most specific, correct choice for this direct action.
- **Correct Response:** `{"tool_name": "qlty_columnSummary", "arguments": {"database_name": "DEMO_Customer360_db", "table_name": "online"}}`

**Example 2: Pre-defined Analysis Request**
- **User Query:** "describe the business purpose of the 'DEMO_Customer360_db' database"
- **Thought Process:**
    1. The user's request is for a "business purpose" description, which is a pre-defined analysis. I will check for a matching prompt first.
    2. The `generic_database_analysis_prompt` is described as being for this exact purpose. It is a strong semantic match.
    3. According to my critical rule, I **MUST** select this prompt. I am forbidden from creating a multi-step plan to get the DDL and then summarize it.
- **Correct Response:** `{"prompt_name": "generic_database_analysis_prompt", "arguments": {"database_name": "DEMO_Customer360_db"}}`

# Best Practices
- **Context is Key:** Always use information from previous turns to fill in arguments like `database_name` or `table_name`.
- **Error Recovery:** If a tool fails, analyze the error message and attempt to call the tool again with corrected parameters. Only ask the user for clarification if you cannot recover.
- **SQL Generation:** When using the `base_readQuery` tool, you MUST use fully qualified table names in your SQL (e.g., `SELECT ... FROM my_database.my_table`).
- **Time-Sensitive Queries:** For queries involving relative dates (e.g., 'today', 'this week'), you MUST use the `TDA_CurrentDate` tool first to determine the current date before proceeding.
- **Out of Scope:** If the user's request is unrelated to the available capabilities, you should politely explain that you cannot fulfill the request and restate your purpose.
- **CRITICAL: Avoid Repetitive Behavior.** You are a highly intelligent agent. Do not get stuck in a loop by repeating the same tool calls or by cycling through the same set of tools. Once a tool has returned a successful result with data that is relevant to the user's request, do not call that same tool again unless there is a new and compelling reason to do so.

USER PROMPT:

You are an expert strategic planning assistant. Your task is to analyze a user's request or a complex workflow goal and decompose it into a high-level, phased meta-plan. This plan will serve as a state machine executor.

---
### Critical Directives
You MUST follow these directives in order to create a valid and efficient plan.


--- CONSTRAINTS ---
You are explicitly forbidden from using the following capabilities in your plan under any circumstances:
- `sales_top_customers` (tool)
- `base_query` (prompt)
- `qlty_databaseQuality` (prompt)
- `dba_databaseLineage` (prompt)
- `base_tableBusinessDesc` (prompt)
- `base_databaseBusinessDesc` (prompt)
- `dba_databaseHealthAssessment` (prompt)
- `dba_userActivityAnalysis` (prompt)
- `dba_systemVoice` (prompt)
- `dba_tableArchive` (prompt)
- `dba_tableDropImpact` (prompt)
- `_testMyServer` (prompt)




CRITICAL RULE (Analytical Prompt Expansion): When you are creating a new plan to fulfill the goal of an analytical prompt (e.g., a prompt that provides a 'description' or 'summary'), the new plan MUST follow a 'gather-then-synthesize' structure. The initial phase(s) must gather the necessary data, and the final phase MUST be a call to TDA_LLMTask to analyze the gathered data and produce the final report.

1.  **Analyze Goal and Context**: First, carefully read the user's `GOAL` and review the `CONTEXT` section to understand the full intent and what actions have already been taken.
    **CRITICAL RULE (Grounding):** Your primary objective is to answer the user's `GOAL` using data from the available tools. You **MUST** prioritize using a data-gathering tool if the `Workflow History` does not contain a direct and complete answer to the user's `GOAL`.

2.  **CRITICAL RULE (Answer from History):** If the `Workflow History` contains enough information to fully answer the user's `GOAL`, your response **MUST be a single JSON object** for a one-phase plan. This plan **MUST** call the `TDA_LLMTask` tool. You **MUST** write the complete, final answer text inside the `synthesized_answer` argument within that tool call. **You are acting as a planner; DO NOT use the `FINAL_ANSWER:` format.**

3.  **Identify Conversational Turns**: If the user's `GOAL` is purely conversational (e.g., a greeting like "hello") and does not require any data or action, your response **MUST be a single JSON object**: `{"plan_type": "conversational", "response": "I'm doing well, thank you for asking! How can I help you with your Teradata database system today?"}`.

4.  **Handle Context and Parameters Correctly**:
    * **Prioritize the Goal**: You **MUST** prioritize entities from the user's current `GOAL` over conflicting information in the `Workflow History`. The history is for supplementing missing information, not for overriding the current request.
    * **Extract Parameters**: You **MUST** meticulously scan the `GOAL` for entities that correspond to tool arguments (e.g., table names) and populate the `"arguments"` block in your plan phase with these key-value pairs.

5.  **Follow the Plan Architecture**:
    * Your plan **MUST** follow a strict "data-gathering first, synthesis last" architecture.
    * **CRITICAL RULE (Final Reporting):** After all data gathering and synthesis is complete, your plan **MUST** conclude with a final phase that calls the `TDA_FinalReport` tool. You **MUST NOT** provide arguments for this tool; its purpose is to trigger the final, structured summarization.
    * **CRITICAL RULE (Simple Synthesis Efficiency):** If the **only** remaining task after gathering data is a simple synthesis (e.g., counting items, listing names from results, summarizing findings, assessing quality), you **MUST** proceed directly to the final reporting phase by calling the `TDA_FinalReport` tool. Do **NOT** create an intermediate `TDA_LLMTask` phase for these simple operations.
    * **CRITICAL STRATEGY (Component Iteration):** If the GOAL requires applying one or more tools to every component of a single entity (e.g., checking the quality of "every column" in a table), your plan MUST be structured to iterate over those components. The first phase MUST retrieve the list of components (e.g., using `base_columnDescription`). All subsequent analytical phases that operate on these components MUST be defined with `"type": "loop"` and a corresponding `"loop_over"` key to ensure each component is processed individually.

6.  **Optimize for Efficiency**:
    * **General Principle**: Your plan **MUST** be as efficient as possible. You should always try to combine multiple logical steps into a single phase if one tool can perform the combined operation.
    * **CRITICAL STRATEGY (Query Pushdown Efficiency)**: Always prefer a single action that filters data at the source over multiple steps that retrieve unfiltered data and then filter it.
        * **HIGHLY PREFERRED:** Use a tool that accepts a filter (e.g., a `sql` parameter with a `WHERE` clause) to request *only the specific data you need*.
        * **AVOID IF POSSIBLE:** Do not use a general-purpose "list" tool and then follow it with a second phase to find a specific item.
        * **FILTERING RULE:** If you must use a general-purpose 'list' tool to find a specific item before acting on it, you **MUST** construct a three-phase plan:
            1.  **Phase 1 (List):** Call the appropriate 'list' tool (e.g., `base_databaseList`).
            2.  **Phase 2 (Filter):** Call the specialized `TDA_LLMFilter` tool. The goal of this phase is *only* to find and extract the specific item's name from the results of Phase 1. You MUST pass the goal to the `goal` argument and the results of the previous phase to the `data_to_filter` argument.
            3.  **Phase 3 (Act):** Call the final tool (e.g., `base_tableList`), using the single, extracted item name from Phase 2 as its argument.
            This three-step `List -> Filter -> Act` pattern is mandatory for these scenarios.
    
    **CRITICAL STRATEGY (SQL Consolidation):** Before creating a multi-step plan, first consider if the user's entire request can be fulfilled with a single, consolidated SQL query. If the goal involves a sequence of filtering, joining, or looking up data (e.g., "find all tables in a database that contains X"), you **MUST** favor using one of the following capabilities to write a single statement that performs the entire operation: `base_teradata_query` (prompt), `base_readQuery` (tool). Avoid creating multiple `base_...List` steps if a single query would be more efficient.

7.  **Maintain Simplicity and Focus**:
    * If the `GOAL` can be answered with a single tool call, your plan **MUST** consist of only that single phase. Do not add unnecessary synthesis phases for simple data retrieval.
    * Every phase **MUST** correspond to a concrete, executable action. Do **NOT** create phases for simple verification or acknowledgement.

8.  **Adhere to Structural Rules**:
    * **CRITICAL RULE (Plan Flattening)**: Your plan **MUST ALWAYS** be a flat, sequential list of phases. You **MUST NOT** create nested structures. Decompose tasks with nested logic into multiple, sequential looping phases.
    * **CRITICAL RULE (Capability Type Enforcement)**: Your selection **MUST** strictly adhere to the capability type. You are **forbidden** from placing a `(prompt)` in the `"relevant_tools"` list or a `(tool)` in the `"executable_prompt"` field.

9.  **Ensure Stability**:
    * **CRITICAL RULE (Recursion Prevention)**: Review the `Current Execution Depth`. You **MUST NOT** create a plan that calls an `executable_prompt` if the depth is approaching the maximum of 5. If you are already inside an `Active Prompt`, you **MUST NOT** create a plan that calls that same prompt again.

---
### Plan JSON Structure
Your output **MUST** be a single, valid JSON array of phase objects. Each object must follow this structure:

-   `"phase"`: An integer, starting from 1.
-   `"goal"`: A concise string describing what this phase will accomplish. You MUST embed any relevant parameters from the user's goal directly into this string.
-   `"type"`: (Optional) Use `"loop"` if the phase needs to iterate over the results of a previous phase.
-   `"loop_over"`: (Required if `type` is `"loop"`) A string identifying the source of items to loop over (e.g., `"result_of_phase_1"`).
-   `"relevant_tools"`: A JSON array containing the single string name of the `(tool)` to be used in this phase.
-   `"executable_prompt"`: A string name of the `(prompt)` to be used in this phase.
-   `"arguments"`: (Optional) A JSON object of key-value pairs for the selected capability. You can use placeholders like `"result_of_phase_1"` to pass data between phases.

### EXAMPLE (Final Reporting)
- **User Goal**: "Summarize the errors in the 'DEMO_DB' database."
- **Correct Plan**:
  ```json
  [
    {
      "phase": 1,
      "goal": "Get a list of all tables in the 'DEMO_DB' database.",
      "relevant_tools": ["base_tableList"],
      "arguments": {"database_name": "DEMO_DB"}
    },
    {
      "phase": 2,
      "goal": "Loop over the tables and check for missing values in each one.",
      "type": "loop",
      "loop_over": "result_of_phase_1",
      "relevant_tools": ["qlty_missingValues"]
    },
    {
      "phase": 3,
      "goal": "Generate the final report based on the data gathered.",
      "relevant_tools": ["TDA_FinalReport"],
      "arguments": {}
    }
  ]
```
