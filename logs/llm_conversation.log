Generic self-correction for failed tool call: base_readQuery
--- RESPONSE ---
The error message indicates that the table `TDWM.TDWMEventMapping` does not exist or is not accessible in the current context. The error explicitly states "Reference to function 'TDWMEventMapping' is not allowed in this context." This suggests either the object doesn't exist, or the user lacks the necessary permissions. Instead of retrying the same query, let's first check if the database `TDWM` exists and list the tables within it to verify the table name and its availability.

{"tool_name": "base_tableList", "arguments": {"database_name": "TDWM"}}
