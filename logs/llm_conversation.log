Generic self-correction for failed tool call: sql_Execute_Full_Pipeline
--- RESPONSE ---
I'll analyze the error and determine the best recovery action.

Key Observations:
- The error indicates that the database 'feature_ext_db' does not exist
- The original request was to execute a similarity search for buying patterns
- The tool `sql_Execute_Full_Pipeline` failed due to a database connection issue

Recovery Strategy:
1. First, I'll verify the available databases using `base_databaseList`
2. Then, I'll check the tables in the `fitness_db` we previously examined

{"tool_name": "base_databaseList"}

This approach will help us understand which databases are accessible and guide our next steps for finding buying patterns in the available data.

Generic self-correction for failed tool call: sql_Execute_Full_Pipeline
--- RESPONSE ---
Based on the error message and available capabilities, I'll develop a multi-step approach to investigate buying patterns.

1. First, I'll verify the database contents:
{"tool_name": "base_tableList", "arguments": {"database_name": "fitness_db"}}

2. Then, I'll analyze the sales data to understand buying patterns:
{"tool_name": "base_readQuery", "arguments": {"sql": "SELECT 
    p.ProductType, 
    COUNT(sd.SaleDetailID) as TotalSales, 
    SUM(sd.Quantity) as TotalQuantitySold,
    AVG(sd.UnitPrice) as AveragePrice,
    SUM(sd.Quantity * sd.UnitPrice) as TotalRevenue
FROM 
    fitness_db.SaleDetails sd
JOIN 
    fitness_db.Products p ON sd.ProductID = p.ProductID
GROUP BY 
    p.ProductType
ORDER BY 
    TotalSales DESC, TotalRevenue DESC
LIMIT 10;"}}

3. I'll complement this with a customer segmentation query:
{"tool_name": "base_readQuery", "arguments": {"sql": "WITH CustomerPurchases AS (
    SELECT 
        c.CustomerID,
        c.City,
        COUNT(DISTINCT s.SaleID) as NumPurchases,
        SUM(s.TotalAmount) as TotalSpent,
        AVG(s.TotalAmount) as AvgPurchaseValue
    FROM 
        fitness_db.Customers c
    JOIN 
        fitness_db.Sales s ON c.CustomerID = s.CustomerID
    GROUP BY 
        c.CustomerID, c.City
)
SELECT 
    City,
    COUNT(CustomerID) as NumCustomers,
    AVG(NumPurchases) as AvgPurchasesPerCustomer,
    AVG(TotalSpent) as AvgTotalSpent
FROM 
    CustomerPurchases
GROUP BY 
    City
ORDER BY 
    AvgTotalSpent DESC
LIMIT 10;"}}

This approach will provide comprehensive insights into buying patterns across product types and customer segments.
