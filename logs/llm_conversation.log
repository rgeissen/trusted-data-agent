Executing CoreLLMTask: Analyze the voluminous raw data from the previous loops. Your task is to distill this information. For each item (e.g., table) processed, produce a concise, one-paragraph summary of the most critical findings. Your output MUST be a clean list of these summary objects, each containing the item's name and the summary text.

Executing CoreLLMTask: # Name:  Database data quality assessment

# Description: 
You are a Teradata User who is a data quality expert focused on tables and their use for analytics.

# Process 
- You will work through all the phases in order
- You will complete a phase and pass the outcomes to the subsequent phase
- You will be assessing the fitness_db database and all the tables in it

## Phase 1 - get database tables
- Get a list of tables in the fitness_db database using the td_base_tableList tool
- Create a list of database_name.table_name for the next phase

## Phase 2 - collect table information
Cycle through the list of tables, for each table do the following steps in order:
- Step 1 - using the td_base_tableDDL tool to get the table structure, using the structure generate a business description of the table and all of the columns.
- Step 2 - using the qlty_columnSummary tool, gather column statistics for the table
- Step 3 - using the qlty_univariateStatistics tool to get the univariate statistics for a table 
- Step 4 - using the qlty_rowsWithMissingValues tool to get rows with missing values in a table

## Phase 3 - Present results as a dashboard
- At the beginning of the dashboard identify the database
- For each table present the results from phase 2 together
- Ensure that each table is presented the same way
- Use color to highlight points of interest

# Communication guidelines
- Be concise but informative in your explanation
- Clearly indicate which phase you are currently in and only focus on the activities of the current phase
- Summarize the outcome of the phase before moving to the next phase

# Final output
A professional data quality dashboard that is easily navigable.

--- RESPONSE ---
The quality of the fitness_db database is generally high, with most tables exhibiting complete data and appropriate data types. The 'ServiceTickets' table shows some incompleteness in the 'ResolutionDate' column, which may affect detailed service resolution analysis.

# Database Quality Assessment Dashboard

### Database: fitness_db

## Table Summaries:

-   **SaleDetails:** The SaleDetails table provides information about the individual items included in each sale, including the product, quantity, and unit price. It has no missing values, with integer datatypes for SaleID, ProductID, Quantity, and SaleDetailID and a DECIMAL(10,2) for UnitPrice. The data types and statistics suggest this table is well-maintained and suitable for analysis.
-   **Products:** The Products table stores information about the products, including the product name, type, brand, price, and stock quantity. There are no missing values in any column. The numerical column 'Price' shows a wide range and skewness, indicating a diverse product portfolio. 'StockQuantity' also varies significantly, potentially affecting inventory management.
-   **Customers:** The Customers table contains customer-related information such as name, contact details, address, and registration date. There are no missing values, ensuring data integrity for customer relationship management and targeted marketing activities.
-   **ServiceTickets:** The ServiceTickets table records customer service tickets with details on the issue, status, and resolution. The 'ResolutionDate' column has 59% missing values, which can hinder analysis on resolution times. All other columns have complete data, providing accurate insights into service-related issues.
-   **Sales:** The Sales table captures sales transactions, including the customer, date, total amount, and sales person. There are no missing values, and the table contains an integer datatype for SalesPersonID and TotalAmount is of DECIMAL(12,2) datatype. The numerical columns, such as 'TotalAmount', display statistical characteristics necessary for sales performance analysis.
