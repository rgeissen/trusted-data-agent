Executing CoreLLMTask: 
You are an expert data analyst. Your task is to create a final report for the user based on the provided data and their original question.

--- INSTRUCTIONS ---
Your entire response MUST be formatted in standard markdown and MUST be structured as follows:

1.  **(Optional) Key Metric:** If the answer to the user's question can be summarized by a single primary value (either quantitative like a number, or qualitative like a status), you MUST provide it on the very first line in a specific JSON format. The line must start with `Key Metric: ` followed by a JSON object with a `value` (as a string) and a `label` (a short description).
    - Quantitative Example: `Key Metric: {"value": "21", "label": "Databases on system"}`
    - Qualitative Example: `Key Metric: {"value": "High", "label": "System Utilization"}`
    If there is no single primary value, you MUST omit this line entirely.
2.  **The Direct Answer:** This part MUST immediately follow the Key Metric (or be the first line if no metric is provided). It must be a single, concise sentence that directly and factually answers the user's question.
3.  **Key Observations:** This section MUST start with a level-2 markdown heading (`## Key Observations`). It should contain a bulleted list of all supporting details and context.
4.  **CRITICAL RULE (Observations Content):** The 'Key Observations' section is for **textual insights only**. You **MUST NOT** include raw data, code blocks (like SQL), or titles for data that is presented elsewhere (e.g., 'DDL for table_x:'). Your observations should be narrative sentences that describe what the data means.

--- RESPONSE ---
```json
Key Metric: {"value": "46", "label": "Databases on system"}
```
There are 46 databases on the system, excluding those owned by PDCRADM.

## Key Observations

*   The system contains a mix of 'DataBase' and 'User' type databases.
*   Some databases have descriptive comments providing additional context, such as 'As-A-Service : POG/COG router management user' for TDaaS\_TDBCMgmt2, or 'The ID 'External\_AP' is reserved for use by LDAP Auto Provisioning' for External\_AP.
*   Several databases appear to be related to system functions, monitoring, or management, indicated by names like TDStats, TDBCMgmt, and TDaaS\_Monitor.
*   The 'OwnerName' filter excludes databases owned by PDCRADM, focusing on databases relevant to other users and system processes.

--- RESPONSE ---
Key Metric: {"value": "DEMO_USER", "label": "Active User"}
The user DEMO_USER is currently using the system.

## Key Observations

*   The query identifies active users by selecting distinct usernames from the DBC.SessionInfoV table.
*   The result shows that 'DEMO_USER' is an active user on the system.
*   The SQL query filters out null usernames to avoid including system processes or incomplete sessions.
*   The data is derived from the DBC.SessionInfoV table, which contains session information.

--- RESPONSE ---
The user DEMO_USER had no workload, as they did not execute any queries in the last 7 days.

## Key Observations

*   The provided data shows the query activity for user DEMO_USER over the last 7 days.
*   The `total_queries` field is 0, indicating that DEMO_USER did not run any queries during this period.
*   The `dba_userSqlList` tool was used to collect this information.
*   The status is "success", which confirms that the tool ran without errors and successfully retrieved the query information.
