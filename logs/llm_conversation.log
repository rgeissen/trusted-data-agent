The error message "Syntax error: expected something between the 'DESC' keyword and the 'LIMIT' keyword" indicates a syntax error in the SQL query. Teradata SQL requires the `QUALIFY` clause for limiting after ordering.

Task: Analyze Mikhail Smirnov's past purchases to identify potential cross-sell and up-sell opportunities by comparing his purchase history with all available products. Suggest a targeted list of products for cross-selling and up-selling.
--- RESPONSE ---
Based on Mikhail Smirnov's purchase of the "Life Fitness Club Series+ Treadmill", here are potential cross-sell and up-sell opportunities:

**Cross-Sell Opportunities:**

*   **Fitness Tracker (Fitbit or Garmin):** Since he purchased a treadmill, he may be interested in tracking his performance with a fitness tracker like the "Fitbit Versa 3", "Fitbit Charge 5", or "Garmin Forerunner 245 Music".
*   **Yoga Mat and Accessories:** To complement his cardio workouts, he might be interested in flexibility and recovery. Suggesting a "Gaiam Essentials Yoga Block (Set of 2)", "BalanceFrom GoYoga Mat", or "Manduka PRO Yoga Mat" could be beneficial.
*   **Foam Roller:** A "TriggerPoint GRID Foam Roller" would aid in muscle recovery after treadmill workouts.
*   **Resistance Bands:** The "TheraBand Resistance Bands Set" can be used for warm-up exercises or to add resistance to other exercises.

**Up-Sell Opportunities:**

*   **Higher-End Treadmill:** If Mikhail is enjoying his treadmill, he might be interested in upgrading to a model with more features, such as the "ProForm SMART Pro 2000 Treadmill", "Commercial 1750 Treadmill", or "Sole F80 Treadmill".
*   **Home Gym:** The "Bowflex PR3000 Home Gym", "Marcy MWM-990 Home Gym", or "Bowflex Xceed Home Gym" offer a wider range of exercises, allowing for a full-body workout.
*   **Power Rack:** Suggesting a "Body-Solid GPR378 Power Rack", "Titan Fitness T-2 Series Power Rack", or "REP Fitness PR-1100 Power Rack" along with weight sets could allow Mikhail to expand into strength training.
*   **Adjustable Kettlebell/Dumbbells:** Recommend upgrading to a "Bowflex SelectTech 840 Kettlebell", "PowerBlock Pro EXP Dumbbells", or "SelectTech 552 Dumbbells" instead of fixed weight options.

--- RESPONSE ---
The error message indicates that the `source_data` provided to the `TDA_LLMTask` was empty. This means that the previous phase, which was supposed to provide the data containing information about Mikhail Smirnov's purchase history and the recommended cross-sell/up-sell strategies, failed to do so. To recover, I need to determine which phase generated `result_of_phase_6` and why it was empty. Since I don't have access to the previous phases' logic, I will assume that the data needed to determine the reasoning behind the cross-sell and up-sell strategies is not readily available. I cannot proceed without relevant data.

FINAL_ANSWER: I cannot provide the reasoning behind the cross-sell and up-sell strategies as the necessary data regarding Mikhail Smirnov's purchase history and related recommendations is missing from the workflow.

The error message "Syntax error: ORDER BY is not allowed in subqueries" indicates that the `ORDER BY` clause in the `RecommendedProducts` subquery is causing the issue. Teradata does not allow `ORDER BY` in subqueries unless a `TOP` or `QUALIFY` clause is also used. Since the purpose of the `ORDER BY` is to rank the recommended products, it is better to move the ordering to the outer query. I will use the `base_teradataQuery` prompt to rewrite the query with the `ORDER BY` clause outside the subquery.

```json
{
  "prompt_name": "base_teradataQuery",
  "arguments": {
    "query": "WITH MikhailProducts AS (SELECT ProductID FROM fitness_db.Sales s JOIN fitness_db.SaleDetails sd ON s.SaleID = sd.SaleID WHERE s.CustomerID = (SELECT CustomerID FROM fitness_db.Customers WHERE FirstName = 'Mikhail' AND LastName = 'Smirnov')), SimilarCustomers AS (SELECT s.CustomerID FROM fitness_db.Sales s JOIN fitness_db.SaleDetails sd ON s.SaleID = sd.SaleID WHERE sd.ProductID IN (SELECT ProductID FROM MikhailProducts) AND s.CustomerID <> (SELECT CustomerID FROM fitness_db.Customers WHERE FirstName = 'Mikhail' AND LastName = 'Smirnov') GROUP BY s.CustomerID), RecommendedProducts AS (SELECT sd.ProductID, COUNT(*) AS PurchaseCount FROM fitness_db.Sales s JOIN fitness_db.SaleDetails sd ON s.SaleID = sd.SaleID WHERE s.CustomerID IN (SELECT CustomerID FROM SimilarCustomers) AND sd.ProductID NOT IN (SELECT ProductID FROM MikhailProducts) GROUP BY sd.ProductID) SELECT p.ProductName FROM RecommendedProducts rp JOIN fitness_db.Products p ON rp.ProductID = p.ProductID ORDER BY rp.PurchaseCount DESC;"
  }
}
```

Task: Analyze the products purchased by customers who also purchased the 'Life Fitness Club Series+ Treadmill' and recommend products for Mikhail Smirnov.
--- RESPONSE ---
Mikhail Smirnov has not purchased any products that allow for recommending other products based on similar customers.

The provided data indicates that a query was executed to find products purchased by customers similar to Mikhail Smirnov, but the query returned no results. This means there is no data available to recommend products based on the purchase history of similar customers. To provide meaningful recommendations, Mikhail Smirnov would need to have purchased some products first, or there would need to be other customers with similar purchase histories to Mikhail Smirnov from which to draw recommendations.
