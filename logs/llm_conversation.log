Executing CoreLLMTask: 
You are an expert data analyst. Your task is to create a final report for the user based on the provided data and their original question.

--- INSTRUCTIONS ---
Your entire response MUST be formatted in standard markdown and MUST be structured as follows:

1.  **(Optional) Key Metric:** If the answer to the user's question can be summarized by a single primary value (either quantitative like a number, or qualitative like a status), you MUST provide it on the very first line in a specific JSON format. The line must start with `Key Metric: ` followed by a JSON object with a `value` (as a string) and a `label` (a short description).
    - Quantitative Example: `Key Metric: {"value": "21", "label": "Databases on system"}`
    - Qualitative Example: `Key Metric: {"value": "High", "label": "System Utilization"}`
    If there is no single primary value, you MUST omit this line entirely.
2.  **The Direct Answer:** This part MUST immediately follow the Key Metric (or be the first line if no metric is provided). It must be a single, concise sentence that directly and factually answers the user's question.
3.  **Key Observations:** This section MUST start with a level-2 markdown heading (`## Key Observations`). It should contain a bulleted list of all supporting details and context.
4.  **CRITICAL RULE (Observations Content):** The 'Key Observations' section is for **textual insights only**. You **MUST NOT** include raw data, code blocks (like SQL), or titles for data that is presented elsewhere (e.g., 'DDL for table_x:'). Your observations should be narrative sentences that describe what the data means.

--- RESPONSE ---
Key Metric: {"value": "Variable", "label": "System Utilization"}
System utilization varied over the past three days, with two days showing activity and one day showing no activity.

## Key Observations

*   Two out of the three days show resource usage, including CPU time, I/O counts, and data transfer.
*   One day recorded no resource usage, indicated by "None" values for all metrics.
*   The request count was significantly higher on one active day (1066 requests) compared to the other (12 requests).
*   The total AMP CPU time also varied significantly, with one day at 4.612 and another at 0.168.
*   Similarly, I/O counts and data transfer volumes (ReqIOKB, ReqPhysIOKB, ReqIO GB, ReqPhysIOGB) were substantially different between the two active days.

--- RESPONSE ---
The user is asking for a bar chart describing system utilization for the past 3 days, and the following is the response:

Here is a bar chart that describes request counts, a measure of system utilization, for the past 3 days.

## Key Observations

*   The bar chart visualizes the request counts for 2025-09-02, 2025-09-03, and 2025-09-04.
*   On 2025-09-02, the request count was 12.
*   On 2025-09-03, the request count was 0.
*   On 2025-09-04, the request count was 1066, showing a significant increase in system utilization compared to the previous days.
