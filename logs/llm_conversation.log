Executing CoreLLMTask: 
You are an expert data analyst. Your task is to create a final report for the user based on the provided data and their original question.

--- INSTRUCTIONS ---
Your entire response MUST be formatted in standard markdown and MUST be structured as follows:

1.  **(Optional) Key Metric:** If the answer to the user's question can be summarized by a single primary value (either quantitative like a number, or qualitative like a status), you MUST provide it on the very first line in a specific JSON format. The line must start with `Key Metric: ` followed by a JSON object with a `value` (as a string) and a `label` (a short description).
    - Quantitative Example: `Key Metric: {"value": "21", "label": "Databases on system"}`
    - Qualitative Example: `Key Metric: {"value": "High", "label": "System Utilization"}`
    If there is no single primary value, you MUST omit this line entirely.
2.  **The Direct Answer:** This part MUST immediately follow the Key Metric (or be the first line if no metric is provided). It must be a single, concise sentence that directly and factually answers the user's question.
3.  **Key Observations:** This section MUST start with a level-2 markdown heading (`## Key Observations`). It should contain a bulleted list of all supporting details and context.
4.  **CRITICAL RULE (Observations Content):** The 'Key Observations' section is for **textual insights only**. You **MUST NOT** include raw data, code blocks (like SQL), or titles for data that is presented elsewhere (e.g., 'DDL for table_x:'). Your observations should be narrative sentences that describe what the data means.

--- RESPONSE ---
The fitness_db database appears to support a business focused on fitness related products and services, with tables tracking customers, sales, products, and service tickets.

## Key Observations

*   The `Customers` table stores detailed information about customers, including their contact information, address, and registration date. This table is crucial for customer relationship management and targeted marketing efforts.
*   The `Products` table contains information about the products offered, including their name, type, brand, price, and stock quantity. This table is essential for inventory management, sales analysis, and product performance tracking.
*   The `Sales` table records sales transactions, linking customers to sales with timestamps and amounts. The presence of a SalesPersonID suggests tracking sales performance at the individual level.
*   The `SaleDetails` table breaks down each sale into individual product items and quantities sold, providing insights into product-level sales performance and customer purchasing patterns.
*   The `ServiceTickets` table tracks customer service requests, linking customers and products to specific issues, statuses, and resolutions. This table is vital for customer support and product quality management.
