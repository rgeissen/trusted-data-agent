2025-09-07 18:58:28,652 - --- REASON FOR CALL ---
Executing CoreLLMTask: 
You are an expert data analyst. Your task is to create a final report for the user by analyzing the provided data and their original question.

--- INSTRUCTIONS ---
Your response MUST be a single JSON object that represents a call to the `GenerateFinalReport` tool.
You are required to populate its arguments based on your analysis of the data.

--- TOOL ARGUMENT GUIDELINES ---

1.  `direct_answer`:
    - This field is REQUIRED.
    - It MUST be a single, concise sentence that directly and factually answers the user's primary question.

2.  `key_metric`:
    - This field is OPTIONAL.
    - Use it ONLY if the answer can be summarized by a single, primary value (e.g., a total count, a status, a percentage).
    - It requires two sub-fields:
        - `value`: The metric's value as a string (e.g., "21", "High").
        - `label`: A short, descriptive label for the metric (e.g., "Databases on system", "System Utilization").
    - If there is no single primary value, you MUST omit this argument entirely.

3.  `key_observations`:
    - This field is OPTIONAL but highly recommended for providing context.
    - It should be a list of objects, where each object has a `text` field.
    - Each `text` field should contain a single, narrative bullet point that describes a supporting detail, finding, or important piece of context.
    - You MUST NOT include raw data, code blocks (like SQL), or titles for data that is presented elsewhere in this field. Your observations should be textual insights only.
