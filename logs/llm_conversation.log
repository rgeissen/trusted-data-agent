The database appears to be designed for managing the sales, products, customers, and service interactions of a fitness-related business. The `Customers` table stores customer details such as name, contact information, address, and registration date. The `Products` table holds information about the products offered, including name, type, brand, price, and stock quantity. The `Sales` table records sales transactions, linking customers to sales with details on the sale date, total amount, and the salesperson involved. The `SaleDetails` table provides granular information about each sale, specifying the quantity and unit price of each product sold in a particular transaction. Finally, the `ServiceTickets` table tracks customer service requests related to products, including the issue description, status, and resolution date. This database would allow the business to track sales performance, manage inventory, understand customer preferences, and address service-related issues.
