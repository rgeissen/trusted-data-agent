A comprehensive analysis dashboard has been created for DBA review with detailed breakdowns of user behavior and system impact over the past 7 days, focusing on resource consumption and query behavior. This dashboard provides insights into user activity patterns, resource consumption rankings, and query complexity.

**System-wide Resource Consumption Overview:** Hourly heatmaps display system-wide resource consumption for the 7-day period. These heatmaps provide a visual representation of resource usage patterns, highlighting peak activity hours and potential bottlenecks. The color coding indicates CPU usage levels, allowing for quick identification of high-consumption periods.

**User Ranking Table:** A complete user ranking table shows CPU time, I/O operations, and memory usage for each user, along with the percentage of total system resources consumed. Users are ranked by resource consumption priority, with CPU time as the primary metric, followed by I/O operations and memory usage. This table enables DBAs to identify top resource consumers and assess their impact on system performance.

**Activity Pattern Analysis:** Activity pattern analysis displays each user's peak activity hours and workload distribution. This analysis provides insights into individual user behavior, identifying when each user is most active and the types of queries they typically execute. This information can be used to optimize workload management and resource allocation.

**Top 5 Resource Consumers Deep Dive:**

*   **Individual User Profiles:** Detailed profiles for the top 5 resource consumers include recent SQL activity logs and execution statistics. These profiles provide a comprehensive view of each user's activity, including the queries they have executed and the resources they have consumed.
*   **Table Access Frequency Analysis:** Table access frequency analysis shows the most queried objects per user. This analysis helps identify the tables that are most frequently accessed by each user, providing insights into their data access patterns.
*   **Query Complexity Distribution and Execution Time Patterns:** This component provides information on the complexity distribution and execution time patterns of queries executed by each user. This analysis helps DBAs understand the types of queries that are being executed and their impact on system performance.
*   **Hourly Activity Charts:** Hourly activity charts show when each high-consumption user is most active. These charts provide a visual representation of user activity patterns, highlighting peak activity hours and potential resource contention.

**Output Format:** The dashboard is presented in a dashboard-style format with sortable tables and visual charts. Color-coded metrics highlight resource usage levels, and specific query examples and table access patterns are included. The dashboard is designed to be mobile-friendly and scale easily, ensuring accessibility for DBAs on the go. This comprehensive analysis provides database administrators with the necessary information for performance monitoring, user guidance assessment, and overall system health management.

Executing CoreLLMTask: Generate a comprehensive Teradata system health dashboard for the last 30 days, structured as an executive summary followed by detailed technical analysis. Create a visual dashboard using tables, charts, and color-coded indicators to highlight critical metrics and resource constraints.

Executive Summary Section:
* System overview with key performance indicators  (number of databases, number of tables, number of views, number of macros, number of user defined views, number of users and space utilization percentages)
* Critical alerts highlighting databases/tables approaching space limits (use red for >85% utilization, yellow for >70%)
* Top 5 resource consumption trends and usage patterns

Detailed Technical Analysis:
* Current database version and system configuration
* Complete space utilization breakdown across all databases with visual charts
* Top 10 space-consuming tables with growth trends and utilization percentages
* CPU Resource usage heatmaps showing patterns by weekday and hour of day
* IO Resource usage heatmaps showing patterns by weekday and hour of day
* Memory Resource usage heatmaps showing patterns by weekday and hour of day
* Flow control metrics and user delay analysis with performance bottleneck identification
* Database and table activity rankings showing most frequently accessed objects
* User activity patterns and resource impact analysis

Formatting Requirements:
* Use color coding: Red (critical/>85%), Yellow (warning/70-85%), Green (healthy/<70%)
* Include bar charts for space utilization and usage patterns
* Present data in sortable tables with key metrics highlighted
* Add trend indicators (arrows/percentages) for changing metrics
* Target audience: DBA management and Teradata system owners
* Focus on informational assessment rather than actionable recommendation
