Task: Describe the fitness_db database in a business context based on the business descriptions of the tables.
--- RESPONSE ---
The fitness_db database is designed to manage and analyze fitness-related business operations. It includes data about products, sales, customers, and service interactions, enabling the business to track sales performance, manage customer relationships, and provide product support.

***Database Name:*** `fitness_db`

***Description:*** The `fitness_db` database contains tables that support the operational and analytical needs of a fitness-related business. The `Products` table stores information about the products offered, including their name, type, brand, price, and stock quantity. The `SaleDetails` table tracks the specifics of each sale, such as the quantity of products sold and their unit price, referencing both the `Sales` and `Products` tables to link sales transactions to specific products. The `Customers` table holds customer information, including contact details, address, and registration date, facilitating customer relationship management. The `ServiceTickets` table manages customer service interactions, recording the date of the ticket, the issue description, status, and resolution details, while linking back to the `Customers` and `Products` tables. The `Sales` table records sales transactions, including the customer involved, the sale date, total amount, and salesperson, with a primary key constraint ensuring the uniqueness of each sale. Together, these tables provide a comprehensive view of the business, enabling reporting and analysis on sales trends, customer behavior, and product performance.
