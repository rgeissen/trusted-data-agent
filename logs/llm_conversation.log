The error message indicates that "Order-based Aggregate and Ordered Analytical Functions are not allowed in subqueries." This refers to the `QUALIFY ROW_NUMBER() OVER (ORDER BY SUM(s3.TotalAmount) DESC) <= 5` part of the SQL query. Teradata has limitations on using window functions within subqueries.

Since the error is related to SQL syntax, the best approach is to use the `base_teradataQuery` prompt to rewrite the query.

The error message "Syntax error, expected something like a 'SUCCEEDS' keyword or a 'MEETS' keyword or a 'PRECEDES' keyword or a 'BETWEEN' keyword or an 'IN' keyword between ')' and the word 'OFFSET'" indicates a syntax error in the SQL query, specifically related to the `OFFSET` clause used with `QUALIFY` and `ORDER BY`. Teradata SQL syntax might not support the exact syntax used in the original query.

Given the nature of the error, it is best to rewrite the query to be compatible with Teradata. Therefore, I will use the `base_teradataQuery` prompt to rewrite the SQL query.

```json

The error message "Syntax error: Order-based Aggregate and Ordered Analytical Functions are not allowed in subqueries" indicates that the `QUALIFY ROW_NUMBER() OVER (ORDER BY SUM(s5.TotalAmount) DESC) > 4` clause within the subqueries is causing the issue. Teradata does not allow order-based analytical functions within subqueries.

Since the error is related to the SQL syntax and specifically Teradata's limitations on analytical functions in subqueries, the best approach is to utilize the `base_teradataQuery` prompt to modify the SQL query to avoid using `QUALIFY` and `ROW_NUMBER()` within subqueries. The query needs to be rewritten to achieve the same result without using these functions in the subqueries.
