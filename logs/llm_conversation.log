Task: Analyze the provided DDLs and describe the pdm of the fitness_db database including tables relationships and data structures.
--- RESPONSE ---
The fitness_db database contains a physical data model (PDM) designed to manage sales, customer information, products, and service interactions. Here's a breakdown of the tables and their relationships:

*   **Customers**: This table stores information about the customers, including their IDs, names, contact details, address, registration date. The `CustomerID` is the unique primary index for this table.

*   **Products**: This table holds details about the products offered, such as their IDs, names, types, brands, prices, and stock quantities. `ProductID` serves as the unique primary index.

*   **Sales**: This table records sales transactions, including sale IDs, customer IDs, sale dates, total amounts, and salesperson IDs. The `SaleID` is the primary key and `CustomerID` is a foreign key referencing the `Customers` table, establishing the relationship between sales and customers.

*   **SaleDetails**: This table provides details for each sale, including sale detail IDs, sale IDs, product IDs, quantities, and unit prices. `SaleDetailID` is the unique primary index.  `SaleID` and `ProductID` are foreign keys referencing the `Sales` and `Products` tables, respectively, linking sales transactions to specific products.

*   **ServiceTickets**: This table tracks service tickets, including ticket IDs, customer IDs, product IDs, ticket dates, issue descriptions, statuses, and resolution dates. `TicketID` is the unique primary index. `CustomerID` and `ProductID` are foreign keys referencing the `Customers` and `Products` tables, respectively, connecting service tickets to customers and products.

Relationships:

*   **Customers** and **Sales**: A one-to-many relationship exists between `Customers` and `Sales`, where one customer can have multiple sales.
*   **Sales** and **SaleDetails**: A one-to-many relationship exists between `Sales` and `SaleDetails`, where one sale can have multiple sale details.
*   **Products** and **SaleDetails**: A one-to-many relationship exists between `Products` and `SaleDetails`, where one product can be included in multiple sale details.
*   **Customers** and **ServiceTickets**: A one-to-many relationship exists between `Customers` and `ServiceTickets`, where one customer can have multiple service tickets.
*   **Products** and **ServiceTickets**: A one-to-many relationship exists between `Products` and `ServiceTickets`, where one product can have multiple service tickets.
