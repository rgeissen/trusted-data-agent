Executing CoreLLMTask: 
You are an expert data analyst. Your task is to create a final report for the user based on the provided data and their original question.

--- INSTRUCTIONS ---
Your entire response MUST be formatted in standard markdown and MUST be structured as follows:

1.  **(Optional) Key Metric:** If the answer to the user's question can be summarized by a single primary value (either quantitative like a number, or qualitative like a status), you MUST provide it on the very first line in a specific JSON format. The line must start with `Key Metric: ` followed by a JSON object with a `value` (as a string) and a `label` (a short description).
    - Quantitative Example: `Key Metric: {"value": "21", "label": "Databases on system"}`
    - Qualitative Example: `Key Metric: {"value": "High", "label": "System Utilization"}`
    If there is no single primary value, you MUST omit this line entirely.
2.  **The Direct Answer:** This part MUST immediately follow the Key Metric (or be the first line if no metric is provided). It must be a single, concise sentence that directly and factually answers the user's question.
3.  **Key Observations:** This section MUST start with a level-2 markdown heading (`## Key Observations`). It should contain a bulleted list of all supporting details and context.
4.  **CRITICAL RULE (Observations Content):** The 'Key Observations' section is for **textual insights only**. You **MUST NOT** include raw data, code blocks (like SQL), or titles for data that is presented elsewhere (e.g., 'DDL for table_x:'). Your observations should be narrative sentences that describe what the data means.

--- RESPONSE ---
`Key Metric: {"value": "High", "label": "Database Quality"}`

The quality of the database `fitness_db` is high, as evidenced by the comprehensive data analysis across multiple tables.

## Key Observations
- **Sales Table:** 
  - All columns (`CustomerID`, `SalesPersonID`, `SaleID`, `SaleDate`, `TotalAmount`) have 100% non-null values.
  - The `TotalAmount` column shows a high coefficient of variation (1.4306), indicating significant variability in sale amounts.
  - The `SalesPersonID` column has a low coefficient of variation (0.0755), suggesting consistent sales personnel involvement.
  - The `SaleID` and `CustomerID` columns have a coefficient of variation of 0.0276 and 0.5745, respectively, indicating a relatively uniform distribution of sales and customers.
- **SaleDetails Table:**
  - All columns (`SaleDetailID`, `SaleID`, `ProductID`, `Quantity`, `UnitPrice`) have 100% non-null values.
  - The `Quantity` column has very low variability (coefficient of variation of 0.1642), indicating consistent quantities sold.
  - The `UnitPrice` column shows high variability (coefficient of variation of 1.4638), similar to the `TotalAmount` in the Sales table.
- **Products Table:**
  - All columns (`ProductID`, `ProductName`, `ProductType`, `Brand`, `Price`, `StockQuantity`) have 100% non-null values.
  - The `Price` column has a high coefficient of variation (1.4369), indicating diverse product pricing.
  - The `StockQuantity` column shows moderate variability (coefficient of variation of 1.0932), suggesting varying stock levels.
- **ServiceTickets Table:**
  - Most columns (`TicketID`, `CustomerID`, `ProductID`, `TicketDate`, `IssueDescription`, `Status`) have 100% non-null values.
  - The `ResolutionDate` column has 59% null values, indicating that many service tickets are still open.
- **Customers Table:**
  - All columns (`CustomerID`, `FirstName`, `LastName`, `Email`, `Phone`, `Address`, `City`, `State`, `ZipCode`, `RegistrationDate`) have 100% non-null values.
  - The `CustomerID` column has a coefficient of variation of 0.5745, similar to the `CustomerID` in the Sales table, indicating a consistent customer base.
