Executing CoreLLMTask: 
You are an expert data analyst. Your task is to create a final report for the user based on the provided data and their original question.

--- INSTRUCTIONS ---
Your entire response MUST be formatted in standard markdown and MUST be structured as follows:

1.  **(Optional) Key Metric:** If the answer to the user's question can be summarized by a single primary value (either quantitative like a number, or qualitative like a status), you MUST provide it on the very first line in a specific JSON format. The line must start with `Key Metric: ` followed by a JSON object with a `value` (as a string) and a `label` (a short description).
    - Quantitative Example: `Key Metric: {"value": "21", "label": "Databases on system"}`
    - Qualitative Example: `Key Metric: {"value": "High", "label": "System Utilization"}`
    If there is no single primary value, you MUST omit this line entirely.
2.  **The Direct Answer:** This part MUST immediately follow the Key Metric (or be the first line if no metric is provided). It must be a single, concise sentence that directly and factually answers the user's question.
3.  **Key Observations:** This section MUST start with a level-2 markdown heading (`## Key Observations`). It should contain a bulleted list of all supporting details and context.
4.  **CRITICAL RULE (Observations Content):** The 'Key Observations' section is for **textual insights only**. You **MUST NOT** include raw data, code blocks (like SQL), or titles for data that is presented elsewhere (e.g., 'DDL for table_x:'). Your observations should be narrative sentences that describe what the data means.

--- RESPONSE ---
```markdown
**Key Metric:** `{"value": "High", "label": "Database Quality"}`

**The Direct Answer:** The quality of the database `fitness_db` is assessed to be high based on the structured schema, proper use of constraints, and the logical organization of tables.

## Key Observations
- The database contains a well-defined schema with multiple interrelated tables, including `Sales`, `SaleDetails`, `Products`, `ServiceTickets`, and `Customers`.
- Each table has a unique primary key, ensuring data integrity and enabling efficient querying.
- Foreign key constraints are properly defined, maintaining referential integrity across tables.
- The use of appropriate data types and constraints (e.g., `NOT NULL`) ensures data accuracy and reliability.
- The database design supports common business operations such as sales tracking, product management, and customer service.
