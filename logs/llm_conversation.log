Client-Side Tool Call: TDA_LLMTask
Task: Describe the fitness_db database in a business context based on the business descriptions of the tables.
--- RESPONSE ---
The fitness_db database is designed to support a fitness-related business, likely a gym, fitness studio, or retailer of fitness products. It tracks customers, sales, products, and service interactions, enabling comprehensive management of business operations and customer relationships.

***Database Name:*** `fitness_db`

***Description:*** The `fitness_db` database encompasses key aspects of a fitness business, managing customer information, sales transactions, product details, and customer service. The `Customers` table stores detailed customer profiles, including contact information and registration dates. The `Sales` table records sales transactions, linking them to customers and including timestamps and total amounts. The `SaleDetails` table provides granular information about each sale, specifying the products sold, quantities, and unit prices, connecting back to the `Sales` and `Products` tables. The `Products` table contains information on the fitness products, including name, type, brand, price, and stock levels. Finally, the `ServiceTickets` table tracks customer service interactions, linking them to customers and products, documenting issues, statuses, and resolution dates. Together, these tables allow the business to track sales performance, manage inventory, understand customer behavior, and handle customer service efficiently.
