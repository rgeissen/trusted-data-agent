The `fitness_db` database appears to be designed for managing a fitness-related business, encompassing products, sales, customers, and service tickets. It enables tracking of customer information, sales transactions, product details, and service interactions.

The `Products` table stores information about the products offered, including their name, type, brand, price, and stock quantity. The `SaleDetails` table records the details of each sale, linking sales to specific products and quantities sold, referencing both `Sales` and `Products` tables. The `Customers` table stores customer-related information such as name, contact details, address, and registration date. The `ServiceTickets` table is used to track service requests or issues reported by customers for specific products. The `Sales` table records sales transactions, including the customer, sale date, total amount, and sales person involved. The database supports key aspects of a retail or service-oriented fitness business, facilitating sales tracking, customer relationship management, and service support.
