Executing CoreLLMTask: 
You are an expert data analyst. Your task is to create a final report for the user based on the provided data and their original question.

--- INSTRUCTIONS ---
Your entire response MUST be formatted in standard markdown and MUST be structured as follows:

1.  **(Optional) Key Metric:** If the answer to the user's question can be summarized by a single primary value (either quantitative like a number, or qualitative like a status), you MUST provide it on the very first line in a specific JSON format. The line must start with `Key Metric: ` followed by a JSON object with a `value` (as a string) and a `label` (a short description).
    - Quantitative Example: `Key Metric: {"value": "21", "label": "Databases on system"}`
    - Qualitative Example: `Key Metric: {"value": "High", "label": "System Utilization"}`
    If there is no single primary value, you MUST omit this line entirely.
2.  **The Direct Answer:** This part MUST immediately follow the Key Metric (or be the first line if no metric is provided). It must be a single, concise sentence that directly and factually answers the user's question.
3.  **Key Observations:** This section MUST start with a level-2 markdown heading (`## Key Observations`). It should contain a bulleted list of all supporting details and context.
4.  **CRITICAL RULE (Observations Content):** The 'Key Observations' section is for **textual insights only**. You **MUST NOT** include raw data, code blocks (like SQL), or titles for data that is presented elsewhere (e.g., 'DDL for table_x:'). Your observations should be narrative sentences that describe what the data means.

--- RESPONSE ---
Key Metric: {"value": "47", "label": "Databases"}
There are 47 databases on the system.

## Key Observations
*   The `base_databaseList` tool was used to retrieve the list of databases.
*   The query used to list the databases filters out databases owned by `PDCRADM`.
*   The output includes the database name, database type (User or DataBase), and a comment string.
*   Examples of database types include `DataBase` and `User`.
*   Some databases have comments associated with them, providing additional information about their purpose.
*   The list includes system databases like `TD_SYSXML`, `SYSLIB`, and `DBC`.
*   It also includes user-defined databases such as `mldb`, `demo_user`, and `val`.
*   Several databases are related to "As-A-Service" (TDaaS), indicating cloud-based services.
*   The `row_count` in the metadata confirms that 47 databases were found.

--- RESPONSE ---
Key Metric: {"value": "5", "label": "Tables"}
The tables in the fitness database are Sales, SaleDetails, Products, ServiceTickets, and Customers.

## Key Observations
*   The `base_databaseList` tool was initially used to confirm the existence of the `fitness_db` database.
*   The `base_tableList` tool was then used to retrieve the list of tables within the `fitness_db` database.
*   The query used by `base_tableList` filters for tables, views, O (queue tables), and Q (hash index tables).
*   The `row_count` of 5 in the `base_tableList` metadata confirms there are five tables in the database.
*   The tables suggest a typical business model with sales transactions, product information, service interactions, and customer data.
