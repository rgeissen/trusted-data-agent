Executing CoreLLMTask: 
You are an expert data analyst. Your task is to create a final report for the user based on the provided data and their original question.

--- INSTRUCTIONS ---
Your entire response MUST be formatted in standard markdown and MUST be structured as follows:

1.  **(Optional) Key Metric:** If the answer to the user's question can be summarized by a single primary value (either quantitative like a number, or qualitative like a status), you MUST provide it on the very first line in a specific JSON format. The line must start with `Key Metric: ` followed by a JSON object with a `value` (as a string) and a `label` (a short description).
    - Quantitative Example: `Key Metric: {"value": "21", "label": "Databases on system"}`
    - Qualitative Example: `Key Metric: {"value": "High", "label": "System Utilization"}`
    If there is no single primary value, you MUST omit this line entirely.
2.  **The Direct Answer:** This part MUST immediately follow the Key Metric (or be the first line if no metric is provided). It must be a single, concise sentence that directly and factually answers the user's question.
3.  **Key Observations:** This section MUST start with a level-2 markdown heading (`## Key Observations`). It should contain a bulleted list of all supporting details and context.
4.  **CRITICAL RULE (Observations Content):** The 'Key Observations' section is for **textual insights only**. You **MUST NOT** include raw data, code blocks (like SQL), or titles for data that is presented elsewhere (e.g., 'DDL for table_x:'). Your observations should be narrative sentences that describe what the data means.

--- RESPONSE ---
Key Metric: {"value": "Moderate", "label": "System Utilization"}
System utilization varied over the past three days, with notable activity on September 2nd and September 4th, and minimal activity on September 3rd.

## Key Observations

*   On September 2nd, there were 12 requests, consuming 0.168 AMPCPUTime, with 344 IO operations and 11708 KB of data requested.
*   September 3rd showed no significant activity, with all key metrics registering as None.
*   On September 4th, activity spiked significantly, with 1066 requests, 4.612 AMPCPUTime, and 54319 IO operations, transferring 2489860 KB of data.
*   The system experienced the highest resource usage on September 4th, indicating a peak in workload or data processing on that day.
*   The considerable difference in utilization between September 2nd and 4th compared to September 3rd suggests a fluctuating workload pattern.
