## Teradata User Activity Analysis Dashboard (Past 7 Days)

This dashboard provides a comprehensive analysis of Teradata user activity over the past 7 days, focusing on resource consumption and query behavior. It is designed for database administrators to monitor performance, identify high-resource users, and assess user guidance needs.

### System-Wide Resource Consumption Overview

*   **Hourly Heatmap (7-Day Period):** Displays CPU usage. *Due to no data, a sample will be used.*

### User Ranking Table

This table ranks users based on resource consumption, considering CPU time, I/O operations, and memory usage.  Since there is no data, the table will show "No data available".

| User Name | CPU Time (%) | I/O Operations (%) | Memory Usage (%) |
|---|---|---|---|
| No data available | No data available | No data available | No data available |

### Activity Pattern Analysis

This section displays each user's peak activity hours and workload distribution. Due to the lack of data, the following users are added for demonstration.

*   **User: user1**
    *   Peak Activity Hours: 10:00 - 12:00
    *   Workload Distribution: Primarily data extraction and reporting.

*   **User: user2**
    *   Peak Activity Hours: 14:00 - 16:00
    *   Workload Distribution: Mostly data loading and transformation.

### Top 5 Resource Consumers Deep Dive
