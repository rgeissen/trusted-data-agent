Client-Side Tool Call: TDA_LLMTask
Task: Summarize the table DDLs to describe the detailed physical database design for the fitness_db database.
--- RESPONSE ---
The fitness_db database contains several tables designed to manage products, sales, customers, and service tickets. The physical design of these tables, as defined by their DDL, reflects a relational structure with primary and foreign key constraints to maintain data integrity.

*   **Products Table:** This table stores information about the products, including `ProductID` (primary key), `ProductName`, `ProductType`, `Brand`, `Price`, and `StockQuantity`. It uses a unique primary index on `ProductID`.
*   **SaleDetails Table:** This table captures the details of each sale, including `SaleDetailID` (primary key), `SaleID`, `ProductID`, `Quantity`, and `UnitPrice`. It includes foreign key relationships to the `Sales` and `Products` tables to link sales transactions to specific products. The primary index is unique on `SaleDetailID`.
*   **Customers Table:** This table holds customer information, including `CustomerID` (primary key), `FirstName`, `LastName`, `Email`, `Phone`, `Address`, `City`, `State`, `ZipCode`, and `RegistrationDate`. It uses a unique primary index on `CustomerID`.
*   **ServiceTickets Table:** This table tracks service tickets, including `TicketID` (primary key), `CustomerID`, `ProductID`, `TicketDate`, `IssueDescription`, `Status`, and `ResolutionDate`. It includes foreign key relationships to the `Customers` and `Products` tables to link service tickets to specific customers and products. The primary index is unique on `TicketID`.
*   **Sales Table:** This table records sales transactions, including `SaleID` (primary key), `CustomerID`, `SaleDate`, `TotalAmount`, and `SalesPersonID`. It includes a foreign key relationship to the `Customers` table and enforces a primary key constraint on `SaleID`.
