**Summary**
The fitness_db database shows high data quality across most tables with no missing values and a high percentage of non-null data. The notable exception is the ServiceTickets table, where the ResolutionDate column has 59 missing values. This indicates potential issues in tracking the resolution of service tickets. Additionally, the SaleDetails table has a low unique entity count for the Quantity column, suggesting limited variability in the quantity of products sold per sale detail. The Products table also shows a low unique entity count for StockQuantity, indicating a concentrated range of stock levels.

Executing CoreLLMTask: 
You are an expert data analyst. Your task is to create a final report for the user based on the provided data and their original question.

--- INSTRUCTIONS ---
Your entire response MUST be formatted in standard markdown and MUST be structured as follows:

1.  **(Optional) Key Metric:** If the answer to the user's question can be summarized by a single primary value (either quantitative like a number, or qualitative like a status), you MUST provide it on the very first line in a specific JSON format. The line must start with `Key Metric: ` followed by a JSON object with a `value` (as a string) and a `label` (a short description).
    - Quantitative Example: `Key Metric: {"value": "21", "label": "Databases on system"}`
    - Qualitative Example: `Key Metric: {"value": "High", "label": "System Utilization"}`
    If there is no single primary value, you MUST omit this line entirely.
2.  **The Direct Answer:** This part MUST immediately follow the Key Metric (or be the first line if no metric is provided). It must be a single, concise sentence that directly and factually answers the user's question.
3.  **Key Observations:** This section MUST start with a level-2 markdown heading (`## Key Observations`). It should contain a bulleted list of all supporting details and context.
4.  **CRITICAL RULE (Observations Content):** The 'Key Observations' section is for **textual insights only**. You **MUST NOT** include raw data, code blocks (like SQL), or titles for data that is presented elsewhere (e.g., 'DDL for table_x:'). Your observations should be narrative sentences that describe what the data means.

--- RESPONSE ---
Key Metric: {"value": "High", "label": "Data Quality"}

The fitness_db database shows high data quality across most tables with no missing values and a high percentage of non-null data.

## Key Observations
- The **Sales** table has no missing values, with all columns having a 100% non-null percentage. Unique entity counts are high for SaleID and CustomerID, but low for SalesPersonID, indicating limited variability in salesperson assignments.
- The **SaleDetails** table also has no missing values, with all columns having a 100% non-null percentage. Unique entity counts are high for SaleDetailID and SaleID, but low for Quantity, suggesting that most sale details involve a single product unit.
- The **Products** table has no missing values, with all columns having a 100% non-null percentage. Unique entity counts are high for ProductID and Price, but low for StockQuantity, indicating a concentrated range of stock levels.
- The **ServiceTickets** table has missing values in the ResolutionDate column (59 out of 100 rows), which may indicate issues in tracking the resolution of service tickets. Other columns have no missing values and a 100% non-null percentage.
- The **Customers** table has no missing values, with all columns having a 100% non-null percentage. Unique entity counts are high for CustomerID, indicating a diverse customer base.
- Overall, the database maintains high data quality with complete records in most tables, except for the ResolutionDate column in the ServiceTickets table, which requires attention.
