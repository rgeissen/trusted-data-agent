Executing CoreLLMTask: 
You are an expert data analyst. Your task is to create a final report for the user based on the provided data and their original question.

--- INSTRUCTIONS ---
Your entire response MUST be formatted in standard markdown and MUST be structured as follows:

1.  **(Optional) Key Metric:** If the answer to the user's question can be summarized by a single primary value (either quantitative like a number, or qualitative like a status), you MUST provide it on the very first line in a specific JSON format. The line must start with `Key Metric: ` followed by a JSON object with a `value` (as a string) and a `label` (a short description).
    - Quantitative Example: `Key Metric: {"value": "21", "label": "Databases on system"}`
    - Qualitative Example: `Key Metric: {"value": "High", "label": "System Utilization"}`
    If there is no single primary value, you MUST omit this line entirely.
2.  **The Direct Answer:** This part MUST immediately follow the Key Metric (or be the first line if no metric is provided). It must be a single, concise sentence that directly and factually answers the user's question.
3.  **Key Observations:** This section MUST start with a level-2 markdown heading (`## Key Observations`). It should contain a bulleted list of all supporting details and context.
4.  **CRITICAL RULE (Observations Content):** The 'Key Observations' section is for **textual insights only**. You **MUST NOT** include raw data, code blocks (like SQL), or titles for data that is presented elsewhere (e.g., 'DDL for table_x:'). Your observations should be narrative sentences that describe what the data means.

--- RESPONSE ---
```markdown
Key Metric: {"value": "47", "label": "Databases on system"}

There are 47 databases on the system.

## Key Observations
- The system hosts a total of 47 databases, comprising both user and system databases.
- Among these, 23 are classified as 'User' databases, indicating they are primarily used for application-specific data storage.
- The remaining 24 are 'DataBase' type, which likely serve system-level functions or store metadata and system-related data.
- Several databases have descriptive comment strings, providing insight into their specific roles or purposes within the system.
- Examples include `TDaaS_TDBCMgmt2` for POG/COG router management and `External_AP` reserved for LDAP Auto Provisioning.
- Many databases have no comment strings, suggesting either generic use or that their purpose is self-explanatory within the system's context.

Key Metric: {"value": "5", "label": "Number of tables in fitness_db"}

The fitness_db database contains five tables: Sales, SaleDetails, Products, ServiceTickets, and Customers.

## Key Observations
- The `Sales` table tracks individual sales transactions, including details such as `SaleID`, `CustomerID`, `SaleDate`, `TotalAmount`, and `SalesPersonID`. It has a primary key on `SaleID` and a foreign key referencing `CustomerID` in the `Customers` table.
- The `SaleDetails` table provides detailed information about each sale, including `SaleDetailID`, `SaleID`, `ProductID`, `Quantity`, and `UnitPrice`. It has foreign keys referencing `SaleID` in the `Sales` table and `ProductID` in the `Products` table.
- The `Products` table contains product information, such as `ProductID`, `ProductName`, `ProductType`, `Brand`, `Price`, and `StockQuantity`. It has a unique primary index on `ProductID`.
- The `ServiceTickets` table records customer service tickets, including `TicketID`, `CustomerID`, `ProductID`, `TicketDate`, `IssueDescription`, `Status`, and `ResolutionDate`. It has foreign keys referencing `CustomerID` in the `Customers` table and `ProductID` in the `Products` table.
- The `Customers` table stores customer information, such as `CustomerID`, `FirstName`, `LastName`, `Email`, `Phone`, `Address`, `City`, `State`, `ZipCode`, and `RegistrationDate`. It has a unique primary index on `CustomerID`.
