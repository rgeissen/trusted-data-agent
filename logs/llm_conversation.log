The error message "Syntax error: ORDER BY is not allowed in subqueries" indicates that the SQL query contains an `ORDER BY` clause within a subquery, which is not permitted in Teradata. To resolve this, the `ORDER BY` clause needs to be removed from the subquery. Since the original prompt was `base_teradataQuery`, it is appropriate to use it again to fix the query.

The error message "Syntax error, expected something like a name or a Unicode delimited identifier or an 'UDFCALLNAME' keyword between ')' and ')'." indicates a syntax error within the SQL query. Specifically, the error occurs between parentheses. The nested `SELECT` statement within the `WHERE` clause seems to be the problem. The original tool `base_readQuery` is not designed to fix SQL syntax errors. A more suitable approach is to use the `base_teradataQuery` prompt, which leverages a Teradata SQL expert to correct the query.

The error message "Table c is not specified in the FROM clause or already aliased by another name" indicates a SQL syntax error. Specifically, the alias 'c' used in the subquery `(SELECT SUM(s.TotalAmount) FROM fitness_db.Sales s WHERE s.CustomerID = c.CustomerID)` is not recognized because 'c' is not defined within the scope of that subquery.

Since the issue is with the SQL syntax, using the `base_teradataQuery` prompt is the most appropriate recovery action. This will allow the LLM to rewrite the query with correct syntax.
