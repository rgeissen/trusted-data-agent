Client-Side Tool Call: TDA_ComplexPromptReport
Goal: # Name:  Database data quality assessment

# Description: 
You are a Teradata User who is a data quality expert focused on tables and their use for analytics.

# Process 
- You will work through all the phases in order
- You will complete a phase and pass the outcomes to the subsequent phase
- You will be assessing the fitness_db database and all the tables in it

## Phase 1 - get database tables
- Get a list of tables in the fitness_db database using the td_base_tableList tool
- Create a list of database_name.table_name for the next phase

## Phase 2 - collect table information
Cycle through the list of tables, for each table do the following steps in order:
- Step 1 - using the td_base_tableDDL tool to get the table structure, using the structure generate a business description of the table and all of the columns.
- Step 2 - using the qlty_columnSummary tool, gather column statistics for the table
- Step 3 - using the qlty_univariateStatistics tool to get the univariate statistics for a table 
- Step 4 - using the qlty_rowsWithMissingValues tool to get rows with missing values in a table

## Phase 3 - Present results as a dashboard
- At the beginning of the dashboard identify the database
- For each table present the results from phase 2 together
- Ensure that each table is presented the same way
- Use color to highlight points of interest

# Communication guidelines
- Be concise but informative in your explanation
- Clearly indicate which phase you are currently in and only focus on the activities of the current phase
- Summarize the outcome of the phase before moving to the next phase

# Final output
A professional data quality dashboard that is easily navigable.

  "executive_summary": "This report presents a data quality assessment of the `fitness_db` database. The assessment involved retrieving table structures, generating business descriptions, collecting column statistics, performing univariate analysis, and identifying rows with missing values. The analysis reveals generally good data quality with no missing values in most tables, however, the `ServiceTickets` table contains 59 missing `ResolutionDate` values indicating incompleteness. Further investigation may be needed into the reasons for this incompleteness.",

      "title": "Database Overview",
      "content": "The analysis focused on the `fitness_db` database.  The database contains the following tables:\n\n*   `Products`: Stores information about products sold.\n*   `SaleDetails`: Contains details about individual items within a sale.\n*   `ServiceTickets`: Tracks customer service requests.\n*   `Sales`: Records information about sales transactions.\n*   `Customers`: Stores customer information."

Includes `SaleDetailID`, `SaleID`, `ProductID`, `Quantity` and `UnitPrice`.\n*   **ServiceTickets:** Stores records of customer service tasks.  Includes `TicketID`, `CustomerID`, `ProductID`, `TicketDate`, `IssueDescription`, `Status`, and `ResolutionDate`.\n*   **Sales:** Records sales transactions, including `SaleID`, `CustomerID`, `SaleDate`, `TotalAmount`, and `SalesPersonID`.\n*   **Customers:** Stores customer details like `CustomerID`, `FirstName`, `LastName`, `Email`, `Phone`, `Address`, `City`, `State`, `ZipCode`, and `RegistrationDate`."

The statistical summary indicated that all data has positive values for numeric fields. \n\nThe `ServiceTickets` table had a significant number of missing values in the `ResolutionDate` column, with 59 out of 100 rows lacking a resolution date. This is a point for further investigation."
