The fitness_db database appears to be designed to manage and track various aspects of a fitness-related business, encompassing customer information, product sales, service requests, and sales transactions. The Customers table stores details about individual customers, including their contact information and registration dates. The Products table maintains information about the products offered, such as name, type, brand, price, and stock quantity. The Sales table records sales transactions, linking customers to specific sales events, and the SaleDetails table provides details about the products sold in each transaction, along with quantities and unit prices. Finally, the ServiceTickets table is used to manage customer service requests related to specific products, tracking the issue, status, and resolution. Together, these tables provide a comprehensive view of the business operations, enabling analysis of sales trends, customer behavior, and service performance.
