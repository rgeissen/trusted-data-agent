Table Fragmentation Analysis

Table fragmentation occurs when the physical storage of table data becomes
scattered across multiple blocks or cylinders.

To check fragmentation on Teradata:

SELECT DatabaseName, TableName, CurrentPerm, PeakPerm,
       (CurrentPerm - PeakPerm) / NULLIFZERO(PeakPerm) as FragmentationRatio
FROM DBC.TableSize
WHERE (CurrentPerm - PeakPerm) / NULLIFZERO(PeakPerm) > 0.20
ORDER BY FragmentationRatio DESC;
