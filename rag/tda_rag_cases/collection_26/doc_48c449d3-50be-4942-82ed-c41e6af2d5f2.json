Simplicity and ease of use, relying as much as possible on the\nnatural boundaries created by distinct primary clusters and compute clusters are primary characteristics.\nBring Your Own Viewpoint\nLearn how to connect your existing multisystem Viewpoint implementation and the primary cluster of a VantageCloud Lake environment.\nPerformance Monitoring and Workload Management APIs\nDescribes the Workload Management and Statitstics Management APIs and how to use them to interface with your custom applications when other tools (such as resource\nusage reports) or client applications do not provide the information you need.\nMonitoring Performance and Resource Usage\nUsing VantageCloud Lake you can monitor the following types of data:\nCurrent system-wide and query performance data. See Monitor Primary and Compute Cluster APIs.\nPast resource usage and query performance as trends or at certain days or times of day.\nLake - Monitor Resources and Performance\nPage 2 of 96To support analyzing trends, Vantage ofﬂoads past resource usage and past query performance data into foreign tables in object storage. These tables contain consolidated\ndata across your primary clusters and compute clusters, enabling you to monitor your compute resources to effectively manage them.\nMonitor Primary and Compute Cluster APIs\nMonitor Resource Usage\nMonitor Compute Cluster Events\nMonitor Queries\nQuery Monitoring Examples\nTroubleshooting: Query Logging Views for Teradata Employees\nMonitor Primary and Compute Cluster APIs\nThese single operational view APIs aggregate performance results from active primary clusters and compute clusters, allowing you to see performance numbers across all the\ndeployed and operational groups. This helps you measure performance of these operational groups and identify sessions that have a negative impact on performance.\nThey also provide a detailed view that provides additional columns to identify the group.\nSee the individual APIs for syntax and examples.\nMonitorAMPLoadSV\nThis single operational view API aggregates AMP load data across VantageCloud Lake clusters.\nMonitorPhysicalConﬁgSV\nThis single operational view API aggregates node availability data across VantageCloud Lake clusters.\nMonitorPhysicalResourceSV\nThis single operational view API aggregates node-speciﬁc RSS data across VantageCloud Lake clusters.\nMonitorSessionSV\nThis single operational view API can return session information across VantageCloud Lake clusters. The API can also be used to trace query sessions to a compute node.\nMonitorSQLCurrentStepSV\nUse this single operational view API for the SQL step being run on the currently running request across VantageCloud Lake clusters. You can then use this function to get\nadditional details on that session to monitor the current SQL step for the SQL run, provided it is a session that is running a query.\nMonitorSQLStepsSV\nUse this single operational view API for SQL steps being run across VantageCloud Lake clusters. Then use this function to get additional details on that session to monitor the\ncurrent SQL step for the SQL run, provided it is a session that is running a query.\nMonitorSQLTextSV\nUse this single operational view for the SQL text value for the current SQL step being run across VantageCloud Lake clusters. You can get additional details on that session to\nmonitor the SQL text for the current step, provided it is a session that is running a query.\nThere are additional APIs that monitor only primary clusters in VantageCloud Lake. See System PMPC PM/APIs and System PMPC Open APIs (SQL Interfaces).\nMonitor Resource Usage\nEach resource usage foreign table represents system usage data from a speciﬁc perspective collected during the logging period. The logging period is a system deﬁned interval of\ntime during which usage data is accumulated (speciﬁed in the NominalSecs column in each table). At the end of the logging interval, usage data is written to each of the resource\nusage foreign tables. Views have been created that are named similarly to the foreign tables in your object storage.\nUse resource usage views for these monitoring purposes:\nAnalyze disk and CPU usage\nProvide different perspectives on disk utilization\nCheck for bottlenecks\nProvide an overall history of the system operation\nMonitor the usage of AMP Worker Tasks (AWTs)\nForeign table deﬁnitions and view deﬁnitions reside in the td_metric_svc database.\nLearn about the data each resource usage view contains:\nresusagesawtV\nresusagescpuV\nresusageshstV\nresusagesldvV\nresusagespdskV\nresusagespmaV\nresusagespsV\nresusagesvdskV\nresusagesvprV\nThese views are not documented:\nresusagesmhmV is reserved for future use.\nresusagelpmaV and resusagelvprV are only used by Teradata personnel.\nresusa gesawtV\nDatabase: td_metric_svc\nIf you need detailed statistics for AMP Worker Tasks (AWT) per AMP in the system, use this view to:\nLake - Monitor Resources and Performance\nPage 3 of 96Get a historical view of AWT utilization across the system.\nGet the length of each AMP message queue (mailbox), the queue which holds work messages from the Dispatcher that are waiting to be serviced by an AMP Worker Task.\nGet the frequency and duration for which an AMP entered ﬂow control during the logging interval.\nView Column Data T ype Format Comment\nLocation VARCHAR(2048) UNICODE CASESPECIFICX(2048) File path in object storage for metric data\nobjects.\npath_component_id VARCHAR(8000) UNICODE CASESPECIFICX(8000) Operational group (primary cluster or\ncompute cluster) ID.\npath_collecttimestamp VARCHAR(8000) UNICODE CASESPECIFICX(8000) Timestamp, in EPOCH timestamp format,\nthis metric data was collected from your\ndatabase and written to object storage.\npath_year VARCHAR(8000) UNICODE CASESPECIFICX(8000) The year in which the data was logged.\npath_month VARCHAR(8000) UNICODE CASESPECIFICX(8000) The month in which the data was recorded\nin the table.\npath_day VARCHAR(8000) UNICODE CASESPECIFICX(8000) The day on which the data was recorded in\nthe table.\npath_hour VARCHAR(8000) UNICODE CASESPECIFICX(8000) The hour at which the data was recorded in\nthe table.\npath_minute VARCHAR(8000) UNICODE CASESPECIFICX(8000) The minute at which the data was recorded\nin the table.\npath_ver VARCHAR(8000) UNICODE CASESPECIFICX(8000) The version of Vantage software that was\nrunning on the operational group.\nTheDate DATE NOT NULL YYYY/MM/DD Local Date of the log entry.\nNodeID INTEGER NOT NULL ZZZ9-9999 Numeric value that uniquely identiﬁes a\nnode (cloud compute instance) within a\ncompute cluster.
