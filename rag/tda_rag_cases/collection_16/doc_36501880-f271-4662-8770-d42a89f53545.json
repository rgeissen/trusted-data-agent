Supports custom machine types and preemptible VMs for cost savings.\n\n### Cloud Storage\nObject storage for unstructured data. Provides multiple storage classes:\n- Standard: Hot data\n- Nearline: Accessed less than once per month\n- Coldline: Accessed less than once per quarter\n- Archive: Long-term archival storage\n\n### BigQuery\nServerless, highly scalable data warehouse. Supports SQL queries on petabyte-scale datasets.\n\n### Cloud Functions\nEvent-driven serverless compute platform. Supports Node.js, Python, Go, Java, .NET, Ruby, and PHP.\n\n## Security Features\n\n- Identity and Access Management (IAM)\n- Virtual Private Cloud (VPC)\n- Cloud Armor for DDoS protection\n- Security Command Center\n\n## Best Practices\n\n1.
