Turn the wheel to switch between four levels of brightness.\nThe Pad and Button Brightness Level Set to Mid.\n1 5\nSetting the brightness to Max only boosts the brightness of the pad LEDs when compared to the High\nsetting, while all the other settings affect the brightness of both the pad and button LEDs. Note that this\nsetting does not affect the brightness of the display.\n3. Move Manager\nMove Manager is a web-based file management tool for Move. It allows you to manage the content\nstored on the hardware: Sets, samples, recordings, and presets, as well as Sets stored in Ableton\nCloud . You can also use Move Manager to update Move’s software or quickly access the Learn\nMove website  and the Move manual.\n3. 1 Connecting to Move Manager\nTo access Move Manager, first turn Move on and either connect it to the same Wi-Fi network as your\ncomputer or mobile device , or connect it to your computer via the USB-C port on the back of the unit.\nUse the USB-C Port to Connect Move to Your Computer.\nNote: On Windows 10, if you want to use USB-C to connect to Move Manager, you will first need to\nupdate Move to version 1. 1 or higher via Wi-Fi. If you cannot connect to Wi-Fi, please refer to this\ntroubleshooting article  in our Knowledge Base.\nTo use Move Manager, you will need Move’s hostname and a supported web browser: Chrome,\nFirefox, Safari, or Edge. You can find the hostname in the Setup’s Move Manager submenu by\nopening the How to access?  entry.\n16\nIf there are multiple Move units on the same Wi-Fi network, each one will use a different name. You\ncan check the name and change it to a different one using the move.local  entry in the Move Manager\nsubmenu.\n3.2 Authenticating Move Manager\nEnter the hostname in a web browser on your computer or mobile device to connect to Move\nManager. When you first open Move Manager, a confirmation code will appear on Move’s display,\nwhich must be entered in the browser to authenticate the connection. This process helps to distinguish\nbetween devices when there are multiple Move units connected to the same network.\nThe Confirmation Code Prompt Displayed in a Web Browser.\nType in the code shown on Move’s display to access Move Manager.\nThe Confirmation Code Displayed on Move.\nNote that Move Manager can only be authenticated in Standalone Mode. If Move is in Control Live\nMode , you will need to temporarily switch back to Standalone Mode to authenticate Move Manager.\n17\nTo do so, open the Setup menu on Move, then select the Standalone entry and press the wheel. Once\nMove Manager is authenticated, you will be able to use it even when Move is in Control Live Mode.\n3.3 Using Move Manager\nAfter you complete the authentication process, the home page will be displayed. From there, you can\naccess several pages where you can manage Move’s content, as well as links to Learn Move videos\nand the Move manual.\nMove Manager’s Home Page.\nAt the top of the home page you will find a Move icon, which links back to the home page from other\npages, as well as a menu. The menu contains entries for accessing the Sets, Recordings, Samples,\nPresets, and Settings pages, and a language chooser. The Move icon and the menu are shared\nbetween Move Manager’s pages, so you can easily access any location no matter which page is\ncurrently open.\nNote that when you access Move Manager from your phone, the menu is slightly different: instead of\nlisting menu entries as tabs, all the entries are contained within a collapsible menu.\n1 8\n3.4 Sets Page\nThe Sets page contains all the Sets that are available on Move, listed with the Set name, last modified\ndate, and size. At the right of each entry on the list you will find options to download, rename, delete,\nor export a Set as an audio file.\nSets Available on Move.\n3.4. 1  Sorting Sets\nYou can sort Sets in ascending or descending order by name, date, or size. To do so, click the field\nthat you want to sort by, and an arrow will appear to the right of the field name. Click on the arrow to\ntoggle between ascending and descending order, or click a different field name to sort by that field\ninstead.\nNote that when using Move Manager on your phone, you can sort Sets via the drop-down menu in\nthe upper-right corner.\n3.4.2  Downloading a Set\nTo download a Set, click on the download icon on the right.\nThe Download Icon.\nThe Set will then be downloaded as an .ablbundle file to the Downloads folder on your computer or\nmobile device.\n19\nNote that on Chrome, when you attempt to download a Move Set, an “Insecure download blocked”\nmessage will be displayed, and you will be prevented from downloading the Set . This warning\nappears because Move Manager uses a .local domain. In order to bypass the warning and\ndownload the Set, select the “Keep” option when the warning is displayed.\n3.4.2. 1  Open Move Sets in Live\nIt is possible to load Move Sets in Live after downloading them. The .ablbundle file is supported in Live\n1 2 or in Live 1 1 when using version 1 1.2 or later.\nTo open a Move Set in Live, double-click the .ablbundle file to open it in the latest supported version\nof Live installed on your machine. Alternatively, you can move the Set to a folder that has been added\nto Live’s Places, and then double-click or drag the .ablbundle file into Live, or you can drag and drop\nthe Set into Live from a folder on your computer.\nOnce opened in Live, the .ablbundle file is loaded as a new Live Set, which you can then save as a\nseparate .als file.\nNote: Drum Racks in Move contain the Drum Sampler instrument, introduced in Live 1 2. 1. If you open\na Move Set that contains Drums presets in Live 1 1 or a version of Live 1 2 earlier than 1 2. 1, Drum\nSampler will be converted to Simpler. This can cause Sets to sound different in Live, especially if Drum\nSampler’s playback effects were used in the Move Set.\n3.4.2.2  Open Move Sets in Note\nYou can also open Move Sets in Note. To do so, open Move Manager in a web browser on your iOS\nor iPadOS device, download a Set, locate it in the Downloads folder of the Files application, then tap\non the Set to open it in Note.\nIf you are using Ableton Cloud on Move  and in Note, any Move Sets uploaded to Cloud will be\nautomatically available in Note.\n3.4.2.3  Sharing Move Sets via AirDrop\nIf you use Apple devices, you can use AirDrop to quickly share Move Sets between them. You can\nsend a Set you downloaded on your Mac to a nearby iPhone or iPad, or vice versa.\nLet’s say you want to share a Set you downloaded from Move Manager  on your Mac to your iPhone,\nfor example. You can do this by opening the Share option on your computer, then using AirDrop to\nsend it to your phone. You can then navigate to the Files app on your phone, locate the Set and tap\non it to open the Set in Note . This works the other way around, too, so you can download the Set to\nyour iPhone, use AirDrop to send it to your Mac, then open the Set in Live .\n20\n3.4.3  Renaming a Set\nTo rename a Set, click on the rename icon.\nThe Rename Icon.\nA dialog will open where you can enter the new name. Click Rename to confirm the change, or click\nCancel to exit.\n3.4.4  Additional Set Options in Move Manager\nClick on the ellipsis icon to access additional Set options: deleting Sets or exporting them as audio\nfiles.\nAdditional Set Options.\n2 1\n3.4.4. 1  Exporting a Set as an Audio File\nTo export your Set as an audio file in the WAV or MP3 format, select the Export as Audio  option in the\nadditional options menu. A dialog will be displayed where you can choose the file format for the\nexport. You can then click on the Export button and a progress bar will appear as the Set is rendered\nto audio. Once the export is complete, the resulting audio file will be saved to your Downloads folder.\nNote that all clips in the Set will be exported, ordered from left to right. If you want to render a Set to\naudio as a complete song, but the Set includes multiple clips with different versions of a beat for\nexample, you may want to first create a copy of the Set, remove the clips that you do not wish to be\nincluded in the audio file, then export the copied Set as an audio file instead.\n3.4.4.2  Deleting a Set from Move Manager\nIf you would like to delete a Set from Move through Move Manager, choose the Delete option from\nthe additional options menu, and a confirmation dialog will appear.\nNote that it is not possible to undo this action.

Connectivity\nMove is designed as a portable instrument you can use on its own to quickly create a musical piece,\nbut its connectivity features also let you expand your setup beyond standalone use. You can sample\nyour environment, connect MIDI devices, jam with other musicians via Link-enabled apps and\ndevices, or upload your Sets to Cloud to continue developing them in Note, Live, or on Push.\n4. 1 Hardware Connectivity\nMove comes with a built-in speaker, an audio output for connecting headphones, powered speakers,\nor external audio interfaces, as well as a built-in microphone and audio input, both of which allow\nyou to sample external audio sources. Move also supports sampling via USB-C and can be used as\nan audio interface with Live (also via USB-C), or connected to MIDI devices through its USB-A port.\n4. 1. 1  Connecting to External Sound Sources\nMove’s audio output port is both a line out and a headphone out. This means you can connect active\nmonitors or an external audio interface to Move using an audio cable, or use Move with\nheadphones.\nAside from using Move’s built-in microphone for sampling , you can also sample sound from external\nsources with Move’s audio input or USB-C port. Note that the audio input works with line-level signals\nsent via an analog cable from audio or mobile devices. In order to connect, for example, a\nmicrophone or guitar pickup to Move you will need to use an external preamp with line-level output.\nThe input and output port are both 3.5 mm.\n4. 1.2  Using Move as an Audio Interface\nWhen Move is connected to a computer via the USB-C cable, it can function as an audio interface by\nrouting audio over the USB connection. The exact functionality differs depending on whether you are\nusing Move in Standalone Mode or Control Live Mode .\nTo use Move as an audio interface on Windows, you first need to download Live 1 2. 1 from your \nableton.com user account  and then install it, which will also install the latest audio driver for Move.\nAlternatively, you can download the driver directly from the Download Archive .\n32\n4. 1.2. 1  Using Move as an Audio Interface in Standalone Mode\nIn Standalone Mode, you can send and receive audio between Move and a connected computer.\nThis means that you can record the signal from any of Move’s audio output channels directly into Live,\nor use Move to monitor or sample audio coming from Live.\nTo record Move’s audio output into Live, first select the output through the USB-C Audio entry  in the\nSetup menu. Then, connect Move to your computer using the USB-C cable, open Live’s Audio\nSettings, and select Move as an input device.\nSelect Move in the Audio Input Device Chooser.\nMove uses a 44, 100 Hz sample rate in Standalone Mode. If a different sample rate is selected in\nLive, no audio signal will be sent.\nOnce you set Move as the audio input, arm an audio track in Live. Next, press the Record button in\nLive, then play Move’s pads, launch a clip or Set, sing into Move’s microphone, or make a sound with\na connected audio source to record the audio into Live.\nYou can also send audio from Live to Move’s main output for monitoring or sampling. To route audio\nto Move, select Move as the audio output device in Live’s Audio Settings.\nSelect Move as the Audio Output Device.\nOnce you set Move as the audio output, enter Sampling Mode  and select USB-C as the sampling\ninput source . You can choose to switch on monitoring ; when on, Move will output audio as soon as\nyou start playback on a track in Live.\n33\nMove can also receive audio from other devices such as smartphones and tablets. You can find out\nmore about monitoring and sampling other devices via USB-C in the dedicated section of the manual .\n4. 1.2.2  Using Move as an Audio Interface in Control Live Mode\nIn Control Live Mode, while you can still route audio signals to and from Move, only Move’s audio\ninput can be sent to a computer. This means you can record audio either from Move’s built-in\nmicrophone or audio input into Live, but not the audio from Move’s main channel.\nYou can also select Move as an audio output in Live and send the audio signal from Live to Move’s\nmain output.\n4. 1.3  Connecting MIDI Devices\nMove can send and receive MIDI notes to and from class-compliant USB-powered MIDI devices.\nLow-speed and full-speed USB devices are supported, but not hi-speed USB devices such as Push.\nYou can connect a MIDI device via the USB-A port on the back of the unit. When a MIDI device is\nconnected, Move can supply it with up to 500 mA of power.\nUse the USB-A Port to Connect MIDI Devices.\nYou can use the MIDI entry in the Setup menu to toggle between the MIDI In Only  and MIDI Out\nOnly  options. If MIDI In Only is active, the currently selected track on Move will receive incoming\nMIDI. If MIDI Out Only is selected, you can set which of Move’s tracks will send out MIDI data.\nTrack 3 Set Up for Sending MIDI Out.\n34\nMove can receive polyphonic aftertouch messages; monophonic aftertouch, MIDI CC, and MIDI\nmapping are not supported. Note that sending and receiving MIDI data does not work when Move is\nin Control Live Mode. For more information, please refer to the USB Operation Modes  section of this\nmanual.\n4.2 Using Ableton Link on Move\nAbleton Link is a technology that keeps devices in time over a wired or wireless network. Link is built\ninto Move, Note, Live and Push, as well as a growing number of iOS applications. Any Link-enabled\nsoftware can play in time with any other Link-enabled software simply by joining the same network.\nTo activate Link on Move, make sure that your unit is connected to the same network as any other\ndevices that you want to sync with. This can be achieved either by connecting Move to the same Wi-Fi\nnetwork as those devices, or by connecting Move via USB-C to a computer that is on the same\nnetwork as those devices.\nOpen the Link entry in the Setup menu and use the wheel to choose between three options: Off,\nTempo and Start/Stop.\nLink Is Set to Tempo.\nTempo  syncs Move’s tempo to the tempo of the Link session. Start/Stop  syncs the playback position\nas well as the tempo. Any start and stop commands triggered on another Link-connected device will\ncause playback on Move to start or stop at the specified point in time. Off disables Link on Move.\nThe first device to join a Link session sets the initial tempo for the other ones. Any Link-enabled apps,\ndevices, or instances of Live can then change their tempo at any time and all others will follow. If\nmultiple participants try to change the tempo simultaneously, everyone else will try to follow, but the\nlast one who changes the tempo will “win.”\nNote that a count-in  cannot be used for recording when Link is enabled.\nIn most cases, Link will work without issues as soon as it is enabled and will provide reliable\nsynchronization under all conditions. If you run into any issues, we recommend checking out the Link\nTroubleshooting article  in our Knowledge Base.\n35\n4.3 Using Ableton Cloud on Move\nAbleton Cloud is a service that lets you store up to eight Sets from Move and Note, which you can\naccess across all Ableton products. You can enable Cloud for use with Move via Move Manager .\nOnce enabled, any Sets that are already stored in Cloud — for example, from Note — will appear in\nthe Set Overview . On Move’s display, each synced Set features a small cloud as part of the Set icon.\nA Synced Set on Move.\n4.3. 1  Uploading a Set to Cloud\nYou can upload a Set to Cloud from the Set Overview.

Like Track Presets, template presets contain one instrument and two effects.\nTemplate presets starting with “Analog” are based on the Drift instrument, while presets starting with\n“FM” and “WT” are based on the Wavetable instrument. The Sampler template preset contains an\nempty Melodic Sampler.\nThere are also three Drum Rack template presets:\nDrum Kit — the default empty Drum Rack. This template preset works best for one shot samples.\nChoke Kit — an empty Drum Rack with the Rack’s choke group enabled. A sample will play\nuntil the next one is triggered. Use this template preset to cut off long samples by triggering\nother pads.\nGate Kit — an empty Drum Rack with the gate envelope mode enabled for all pads. A sample\nwill play for as long as the pad/note is held. This template preset also works well for longer\nsamples.\nUser Presets\nThe User Presets folder contains all the presets that have been created and saved on Move or \nuploaded via Move Manager .\nUser Recordings\nThe User Recordings folder contains all the audio files you have recorded  on Move.\nUser Samples\nThe User Samples folder contains all the samples you have uploaded  via Move Manager and is\naccessible when browsing samples for the Melodic or Drum Sampler instruments.\n7 .2.2  Autoload\nAutoload is enabled for Sets in the Workflow Settings  menu by default. This means that presets are\nautomatically loaded when browsing.• \n• \n• \n52\nYou can move between presets using the wheel while the browser is open, then play the pads or a clip\nto test out the new sound. If you load a preset but then decide to return to the previous device, use the\nUndo button.\nThe Undo Button.\nTo turn Autoload off, hold Shift and then press Step 3 to access the Workflow Settings.\nHold Shift and Press Step 3 to Access the Workflow Settings.\nUse the wheel to navigate to the Autoload On entry and then press the wheel to switch to Autoload\nOff. When Autoload is off, you can load selected presets in the browser by pressing the wheel.\n53\n7 .3 Saving Presets\nIf you adjust an instrument or effect preset to your liking and want to reuse those exact settings, you\ncan save the customized device to the User Presets folder within the browser.\nTo do so, first select the preset you want to save in the Device View using the wheel. Next, press the\nwheel to enter the browser, then hold Shift to access the Options submenu. Press the wheel to open the\nsubmenu, select the Save Preset  entry using the wheel, and press again to confirm.\nSaving a Preset.\nThe new preset is saved to the User Presets folder, and will also be available in the Presets page  when\nMove is connected to Move Manager.\nThe User Presets Folder in the Browser.\nUser presets are automatically named after the device that was used to create them but can be \nrenamed  in Move Manager as needed, as well as deleted.\n8. Note Mode\nYou can build up a Set in Note Mode by playing and sequencing notes , recording and capturing\nnotes , editing notes  and clips, and more.\nTo enter Note Mode from another mode, press any of the track buttons to the left of the pads.\n54\nPress a Track Button to Enter Note Mode.\nYou can also press the Note/Session toggle to access Note Mode from Session Mode.\n55\nThe Note/Session Toggle.\n9. Playing and Sequencing Notes\nYou can use different pad layouts depending on which type of Track Preset is loaded onto the selected\ntrack.\nWhen using Drums Track Presets, you can use the 16 pads on the left to play or sequence the Drum\nRack’s individual samples.\n56\nUse the 16 Drum Rack Pads for Drums Track Presets.\nAdditionally, you can enable the 16 Pitches  layout to play or sequence samples melodically on the 16\npads to the right of the Drum Rack’s pads.\nFor melodic instrument Track Presets, all 32 pads can be used to play or sequence individual note\npitches in either the In-Key or Chromatic Mode .\nUse all 32 Pads for Melodic Instrument Track Presets.\n9. 1 Pad Layouts, Keys, and Scales\nWhen using melodic instruments, there are two modes to choose from: In-Key  and Chromatic . In-Key\ndisplays only the notes within the selected scale, while Chromatic displays all notes, regardless of the\nchosen scale.\n57\nBy default, the mode is set to In-Key in the C Major scale, with notes arranged by octaves. The Keys &\nScales menu offers additional options for customizing the layout. You can arrange notes by 4ths\ninstead of octaves, switch to the Chromatic Mode, or select a different key or scale. To open the Keys\n& Scales menu, hold Shift and press Step 9.\nHold Shift and Press Step 9 To Access the Keys & Scales Menu.\nUse the wheel to scroll through the menu entries, and press the wheel to make or confirm a selection.\nYou can select the In-Key or Chromatic Mode via the first menu entry.\nPress the Wheel to Select a Mode for the Pad Layout.\nIn-Key Mode arranges notes by octaves or 4ths. Use the corresponding menu entry to toggle\nbetween these layouts.\nThe Octaves and 4ths Layouts.\nWhen Octaves is selected, each row of pads represents an octave, with the root note indicated by\npad LEDs in the track’s color. The other notes are indicated by light gray pad LEDs. Only notes within\nthe selected scale are displayed.\n58\nIn-Key Mode’s Octaves Layout.\nIf the selected scale contains more than eight notes, it will be truncated, and any notes beyond the\neighth will not be shown on the pads. For scales with fewer than eight notes, the following octave will\nstart on the same row as the preceding octave until the row is filled.\nThe Octaves Layout for a Pentatonic Scale.\nWhen 4ths is selected, each pad directly above another represents a note a perfect fourth higher,\nwhile each pad to the right of another represents the next scale degree. Pad LEDs for the root note use\nthe track’s color, while the other notes are indicated by light gray pad LEDs. Only notes within the\nselected scale are displayed.\nIn-Key Mode’s 4ths Layout.\n59\nChromatic Mode arranges notes in rows resembling a guitar fretboard. A pad directly above another\nrepresents a note five semitones higher, corresponding to a perfect fourth. A pad to the right of\nanother represents a note one semitone higher. Pad LEDs for the root note use the track’s color. Notes\nwithin the selected scale are indicated by light gray pad LEDs, while pad LEDs for notes outside the\nscale are unlit.\nThe Chromatic Mode.\nThe second menu entry lets you pick a key, which determines the root note of the scale. You can use\nthe third entry to choose the scale.\nSelect a Key and Scale Using the Wheel.\nWhen you are done selecting the layout, key, or scale, press the Back button to return to the Device\nView, or hold Shift and press Step 5.\nNote that changing the key or scale will not transpose any existing notes; it will only update the notes\navailable on the pads. The selected scale settings are saved with the Set.\n9.2 16 Pitches Layout\nWhen using Drums Track Presets, you can enable the 16 Pitches  layout to play a sample melodically\nacross the 16 pads to the right of the Drum Rack pads. Hold Shift and press Step 8 to enable the 16\nPitches layout.\n60\nHold Shift and Press Step 8 to Toggle the 16 Pitches Layout On or Off.\nOnce enabled, you can select a sample in the Drum Rack by pressing its pad, then press any of the 16\npads on the right to play the sample in various pitches.\nThe 16 Pitches Layout.\nThe pitches can be displayed in either the In-Key or Chromatic Mode .\nA sample’s pitch cannot be detected, so all samples are transposed as if their pitch is C. If a sample\nhas a different pitch, the 16 Pitches pads might play notes differently than expected. For example, if a\nsample’s pitch is E, the root note pads will play that pitch when the key is set to C, not E. If you want to\nuse a different key, you can manually transpose the sample’s pitch accordingly. For example, when\nthe key is set to E, you can lower the sample’s pitch by four semitones using the transpose parameter .\nOnce transposed, the root note pads will play E, instead of G#, which is the pitch used when the\nsample is not transposed.\nThe pad LEDs for the root note use the track’s color, while the pad LEDs for notes within the selected\nscale use a light gray color. When using Chromatic Mode, pad LEDs for notes outside the selected\nscale are unlit.\nYou can use the plus and minus buttons to change the octave range for the pitches.\n61\nUse the Plus and Minus Buttons to Change the Octave Range.\nNotes from the 16 Pitches layout can be played, sequenced, recorded, and captured just like notes\nfrom any other pad layout. You can also sequence notes by holding a step and then pressing any of\nthe pads in the 16 Pitches layout.\nTo transpose individual notes added from the 16 Pitches layout, hold a step and use the plus and\nminus buttons.\n9.3 Full Velocity\nMove’s pads are velocity-sensitive, so playing the pads softly results in lower velocity values, while\npressing them harder produces higher velocity values. However, you can switch off this behavior to\nonly play notes at the maximum velocity (i.e., a velocity value of 1 27). To do so, hold Shift and press\nStep 10.\n62\nHold Shift and Press Step 10 to Toggle Full Velocity On or Off.\n9.4 Expressive Playing with Polyphonic\nAftertouch\nAll of the pads are independently pressure-sensitive; this behavior is referred to as Polyphonic\nAftertouch . Drift and Wavetable support this type of aftertouch. This means you can play and hold\nchords with varying levels of pressure to modulate each note’s sound individually when using certain\nTrack Presets.\nNote that Move does not support Channel Aftertouch, where the pressure applied to one pad affects\nall pads simultaneously.\n9.5 Sequencing Notes\nThe step buttons can be used to sequence notes and edit steps. By default, the step grid resolution  is\nset to 1/16 so that each step button represents a sixteenth note division. The line under the Step 1, 5,\n9, and 1 3 LEDs indicates the start of each beat. This means that Step 1 corresponds to the first beat in\na bar.\nThe Step Buttons.\nYou can move between bars  using the left and right arrow buttons.\n63\nThe Left and Right Arrow Buttons.\nTo sequence notes, press a pad, then press a step button to insert a note within the bar. Alternatively,\nyou can press and hold a step button, then press a pad. If the Play button hasn’t been pressed,\ntransport will begin immediately once a note is added in an empty clip for the first time.\nTransport Begins When Notes Are First Sequenced.\nTo remove a note from a step, briefly press the respective step button.\nThe step button LEDs indicate the following:\nA white step button LED indicates that the step contains a note or multiple notes.\nA dimly lit step button LED in the track’s color represents an empty step within the bar.\nDimly lit gray step button LEDs indicate an empty clip or a bar outside of the existing loop\nlength.\nA green step button LED shows the current play position during playback.\nWhen sequencing Drum Rack or 16 Pitches pads, only the notes for the selected sample are shown on\nthe step buttons.\n• \n• \n• \n• \n64\nWhen sequencing melodic instruments, all notes are shown on the step buttons, regardless of pitch.\nYou can add multiple notes to the same step by pressing several pads simultaneously and then\npressing a step button. This is useful for sequencing chords.\nBy default, step sequencing notes creates a new clip  in the track’s first empty clip slot. To add notes to\na different clip, press a pad for an existing clip or an empty clip slot in Session Mode  to access the\nbars for that clip on the step buttons in Note Mode. You can, for example, create a pattern of\nsequenced notes across multiple clips, which can then be triggered in Session Mode.\nCheck out the Editing Notes and Steps  chapter to learn about the various ways you can adjust notes\nand steps.\n10. Tempo, Groove, and Metronome\nSettings\nYou can adjust the tempo and groove for a Set, as well as play or record with a metronome.\n10. 1 Tempo\nTo set the tempo for a Set, hold the Shift button and press Step 5 to access the Tempo setting.\nHold Shift and Press Step 5 to Access the Tempo Setting.\nYou can turn the wheel to adjust the tempo.

Then, press the Record button and adjust one or more of the encoders. The\nvalue changes are recorded as soon as you turn an encoder, indicated by a filled circle next to the\nparameter’s value. Additionally, the corresponding encoder’s LED will turn red.\nAutomation Recorded for the Filter Envelope Parameter in a Wavetable Track Preset.\nYou can only automate parameters for one device or effect at a time. While recording, you can use\nthe wheel to switch between different devices and effects to automate their respective parameters.\nTo stop recording automation, press the Record or Play button, or switch to a different track.\n1 4.2. 1  Deactivating Automation\nIf needed, you can deactivate the recorded automation for a parameter by holding down the Mute\nbutton and tapping the corresponding encoder. A confirmation message will be shown on the display,\nand the automation’s inactive status will be indicated by an empty circle next to the parameter value.\nAutomation Has Been Deactivated.\nTo reactivate automation, hold the Mute button and tap the encoder again.\n86\nYou can also temporarily override recorded automation by adjusting an encoder during playback. As\nyou turn the encoder, you can freely change the parameter value. Then, release the encoder to\nresume the recorded automation.\n1 4.2.2  Checking Automation Status\nYou can quickly check the automation status for device or effect parameters by holding the Mute\nbutton and looking at the LEDs below each encoder:\nAn unlit LED specifies that there is no existing automation for a parameter.\nA red color indicates active automation for a parameter.\nA white color means that a parameter’s automation is deactivated.\n1 4.2.3  Deleting Automation\nIf you want to remove automation for a parameter, hold the Delete button and tap the respective\nencoder.\nAutomation Has Been Deleted.\n1 4.2.4  Per-Step Automation\nYou can also save automation per step, which gives you more precise control over the placement of\nautomation in time.\nTo add per-step automation, select the device or effect whose parameters you want to automate in the\nDevice View, then hold a step button which contains a note and turn one of the encoders.\nOnce you touch an encoder, the step button LEDs following the step you are holding will turn red,\nindicating the automation time range. Typically, the automation time range extends to the note in the\nnext step.• \n• \n• \n87\nThe Per-Step Automation Time Range.\nIt is possible to add per-step automation to several steps at once by pressing and holding multiple\nstep buttons and turning the encoders.\n1 4.3  Capturing Notes and Automation\nSince tracks are automatically armed in Note Mode, you can capture notes or automation without\nneeding to activate recording beforehand. This is useful for improvising or if you forget to press the\nRecord button.\nYou can capture material into new clips or into existing clips via overdubbing. When capturing notes,\nit is assumed that the first played note aligns with the start of the clip, and that all notes are meant to\nbe included in the loop.\nTo capture notes in a new clip, select an empty clip slot in a track in Session Mode, switch to Note\nMode, play the pads, and then press the Capture button.\nThe Capture Button.\nOnce you press the button, a new clip is created in the track, and the transport begins, allowing you\nto hear what was captured immediately.\n88\nIf you capture notes into a new clip while the transport isn’t running, Move will detect the tempo,\ngenerate three BPM estimates, and apply one to the entire Set. The applied tempo will be shown on\nthe display, but you can turn the wheel to choose one of the other suggested tempos if it better\nrepresents the tempo of your playing. Note that tempo estimates are not generated when capturing\nnotes during playback or overdubbing.\nNew Material Was Captured at 85 BPM.\nWhile the tempo estimates may vary, the captured notes will play back at the tempo you played,\nregardless of which BPM is chosen. Selecting a different tempo estimate may change the loop length,\nbut the playback speed remains the same. This is different from setting the tempo manually , which\nchanges the playback speed of the notes but keeps their position in the loop unchanged.\nYou can apply a different BPM manually by holding Shift and pressing Step 5 to open the Tempo\nsetting. Turn the wheel to adjust the value. You can hold Shift as you turn the wheel to adjust the tempo\nin fine increments.\nThe Tempo Setting.\nIt is also possible to capture automation. This can be done at the same time as capturing new material\nor when playing back existing clips. To capture automation, adjust the encoders to change the values\nfor a device or effect parameters, then press the Capture button.\nCaptured notes and automation can be added to existing clips via overdubbing. To do so, play some\nnotes or move the encoders while an existing clip is in focus. The captured material will then be added\nto the clip.\nIf you play the pads or turn the encoders but decide you don’t want the notes or parameter changes\nto be captured, hold Shift and press the Capture button to clear the input.\n89\nCapture Input Was Cleared.\nYou can also clear the input by starting and then stopping transport, or by pressing a track button.\nWhen using these methods, no message is shown on the display, but the Capture button pad LED will\nbe unlit once the input has been cleared.\n15. Sampling\nYou can use Sampling Mode  to sample audio from Move’s built-in microphone, audio input, or USB-\nC audio source, or to resample its main output to create audio recordings that can be used in Drum\nSampler or the Melodic Sampler.\nWhen sampling, the audio is recorded and saved to a pad in a single interaction. You can sample into\nDrum Rack pads as well as melodic pads.\n15. 1 Sampling Mode\nTo start sampling, select a track in Note Mode, then press the Sampling button to enter Sampling\nMode .\nThe Sampling Button.\nOnce in Sampling Mode, the Sampling button LED pulses red, and the Sampling menu opens, with a \nPress pad  prompt shown on the display. If you touch, turn, or press the wheel at this point, Sampling\nwill be displayed instead of the prompt; however, this does not mean that sampling has started — you\nstill need to press a pad to start recording a sample .\n90\nThe Sampling Menu.\nYou can sample into any of the 16 Drum Rack pads or any of the 32 melodic pads. Depending on the\nselected Track Preset  and pad layout , certain pad LEDs turn pink to indicate that Sampling Mode is\nactive:\nThe Drum Rack pad LEDs turn pink when using a drum-based Track Preset.\nThe root note pad LEDs turn pink when using the Melodic Sampler or a synthesizer-based Track\nPreset with In-Key Mode or Chromatic Mode.\nSampling Mode will close automatically when you finish recording a sample. You can also exit\nSampling Mode without having recorded a sample by pressing the Sampling button again, or by\npressing the Back button. Sampling Mode will also close automatically if you switch to a different\ntrack or Session Mode .\n15.2  Selecting a Sampling Input Source\nFour different input sources can be used for sampling: Mic, Line in  (available when an audio source is\nconnected to Move), Resampling , or USB-C . Move can use only one input source at a time.\nYou can view the current source by touching the wheel while in Sampling Mode. The source is also\nindicated with an icon: a microphone, rectangle with an incoming arrow, speaker, or USB-C cable for\nMic, Line in, Resampling, or USB-C respectively.\nThe Mic Input Source Is Selected.\nDepending on whether Move is connected to an audio source or not, Line in or Mic will be available\nas the input source. You can press the wheel to switch the input source to Resampling, which will allow\nyou to sample Move’s main output, or to USB-C, which will let you sample audio coming into Move\nvia USB-C. The last selected input source will be remembered and used the next time you enter\nSampling Mode.\n• \n• \n91\n15.3  Recording Samples\nTo record a sample, press the Sampling button to enter Sampling Mode . Then, press the pad where\nyou want a sample to be recorded. Recording will begin once you press the pad, indicated by the\npad LED pulsing red and the Recording…  message appearing on the display.\nRecording a Sample.\nPress the same pad, any other pad, or the Sampling button to stop recording and exit Sampling\nMode.\nAlternatively, you can hold a pad to start recording and then release it to stop recording.\nYou can record a sample for up to 240 seconds (four minutes). Recording will stop automatically once\nthis limit is reached.\nThe recorded sample is added to the pad’s Drum Sampler or the Melodic Sampler, depending on\nwhich type of Track Preset is selected. You can press the pad you recorded into to play the sample at\nits original recorded pitch. When using the Melodic Sampler, you can play any of the 32 pads, and\nthe sample will be transposed based on the selected scale .\nNote that when sampling into melodic pads, if you load the recorded sample into a different Melodic\nSampler, or reload it into the same Melodic Sampler after swapping samples in the browser, the\nsample’s original recorded pitch will be accessible through the C3 pad, provided that the sample’s\nTranspose parameter  is set to 0. The original pitch of the sample cannot be detected, so all samples\nare transposed as if their pitch is C.\nWhen using the C Major scale in Chromatic Mode , the pad that represents C3 by default is the fourth\npad from the left in the bottom row.\n92\nThe C3 Pad for the C Major Scale in Chromatic Mode.\nIf you sample into a melodic pad on a track that contains a synthesizer Track Preset, the instrument will\nbe swapped to a Melodic Sampler once recording stops. If needed, you can revert this change by\npressing the Undo button, without deleting the sample.\nYou can access all recorded samples in the browser  under User Recordings. Samples are named\nbased on the current Set and the number of existing recordings for that Set. For example, if you record\na sample for the first time in a Set called “Set 5,” the recording will be saved as “Set 5 Rec 1.” Note\nthat if you rename the Set , this will not update the sample name.\nYou can rename, download, or delete samples on Move Manager’s Recordings page .\n15.4  Mic and Line In Sampling\nWhen you select Mic or Line in as the input source for sampling, there are additional options visible on\nthe display, which allow you to adjust the input gain or turn monitoring on or off.\n15.4. 1  Adjusting Sampling Input Gain\nTo adjust the input gain for the Mic or Line in input source, turn the wheel to select the input levels icon,\nthen press the wheel to open the Gain  option and turn the wheel to adjust the level.\n93\nAdjusting the Input Gain.\n15.4.2  Turning Monitoring On or Off\nIf an audio device is plugged into Move’s audio input or output, an option to turn monitoring on or off,\nrepresented by a headphones icon, becomes available in the Sampling menu. Press the wheel to\nchoose between Monitoring Off  and Monitoring On .\nMonitoring Is Switched On.\nBy default, if an audio device is connected to Move’s audio output port, the option is set to Monitoring\nOff. If an audio device is connected to the input port, the option is set to Monitoring On.\nNote: If the option is set to Monitoring On, monitoring will continue to be active even when you exit\nSampling Mode, as long as the audio device is still connected.\n15.5  Resampling\nWhen Resampling  is selected as the input source, you can sample Move’s overall output.\nResampling.\n94\nTo start resampling, press the pad where you want a sample to be recorded. If the transport isn’t\nrunning, playback will start as soon as you press the pad to start resampling. This allows you to sync\nthe beginning of the recorded sample with the start of playback.\n15.6  Sampling Audio via USB-C\nWith USB-C selected as the input source, you can sample audio via USB-C from a connected\ncomputer, smartphone, or tablet. For example, you can play a one-shot from a sample library on your\ncomputer and record the audio into a drum pad on Move, or you can play a synth on a tablet and\nrecord the audio into Move’s Melodic Sampler.\nUSB-C Selected as the Input Source.\nYou have the option to switch monitoring on or off when sampling via USB-C. By default, the option is\nset to Monitoring Off. To switch to Monitoring On, turn the wheel to select the headphones icon, then\npress the wheel. Note that when the option is set to Monitoring On, monitoring will continue to be\nactive even when you exit Sampling Mode, as long as the audio source is still connected via USB-C.\nDevices with USB-C ports typically work with a USB-C cable alone, while phones or tablets with a\nLightning port require an adapter and need to be connected to a charger when sampling. Note that\nsampling into Move via USB-C works only with the USB Audio Class 2.0 protocol, so it might not be\npossible to sample into Move from some Android devices. You can read more about sampling audio\ninto Move via USB-C in this Knowledge Base article .\n15.7  Multi-pad recording\nYou can record the same sample onto separate Drum Rack pads, with a different sample start time for\neach pad. This is useful for triggering different sections of a longer sample across several pads.\nTo record a sample into multiple pads, select a track containing a Drum Rack, activate Sampling\nMode and press a pad to start recording a sample. Then, press a different pad to continue recording\nthe sample onto that pad. You can repeat this for several pads in sequence. As you move to a new\npad, the LED of the previous pad, where part of the sample was recorded, will change from pink to\nthe track color to indicate that the pad already contains a sample.\n95\nRecording the Same Sample Into Multiple Pads.\nTo stop recording, press the currently selected pad again or press the Sampling button. After you are\nfinished, each pad you pressed while sampling will contain the same sample, but the sample start time\nwill coincide with the start of each individual recording, i.e., when you pressed the pad.\n15.8  Sample Slicing\nIn Slicing Mode, you can non-destructively divide a sample into slices that are then assigned to\nindividual Drum Rack pads. This is ideal for working with drum breaks or creating vocal chops.\nTo enter Slicing Mode, hold Shift and press the wheel while a sample is in focus on the display to\nopen the Sample Options menu. Then press the wheel again to select the Slice option.\nSelect Slice in the Sample Options Menu to Enter Slicing Mode.\nBy default, the sample is sliced into equal parts based on its total length. Turn the wheel to change the\nnumber of slices.\n96\nTurn the Wheel to Adjust the Number of Slices.\nUse the first two encoders to adjust the sample region’s start and end points.\nUse the First Two Encoders to Adjust the Sample Region’s Start/End.\nYou can adjust the start point for an individual slice by pressing the pad that corresponds to the slice\nyou want to edit, then turning the third encoder.\nPress the wheel or the Back button to confirm the settings and exit Slicing Mode. This replaces the\nexisting samples with the newly created slices in a new Drum Rack.\nCreated Sample Slices on the Drum Rack Pads.\nNote that any unused Drum Rack pads will remain empty if there are fewer than 16 slices.\nTo remove the slices and restore the original Drum Rack, press the Undo button.\n97\n15.9  Adjusting Sample Parameters\nYou can adjust various sample parameters for recorded samples, as well as for uploaded samples  or\nsamples from the browser, using the encoders.\nTo adjust the sample gain, press and hold a pad, then turn the Volume encoder.\nAdjusting the Sample Gain.\nWhen you tap an encoder, its corresponding parameter is shown on the display. The available\nparameters depend on which parameter bank  is selected. Drum Sampler contains two parameter\nbanks: Main Bank and Filter & Setup. The Melodic Sampler also has two parameter banks: Main\nBank and Setup. By default, the Main Bank parameters are accessible via the encoders.\nAs a Drum Sampler instrument is used for each pad in Drum Racks, you can adjust the parameters for\na sample per pad. If you select the entire Drum Rack in the Device View, the Main Bank parameters\nfor the selected pad will be shown on the display.\nTo switch to Filter & Setup in Drum Sampler or Setup in the Melodic Sampler, highlight the instrument\nor sample with the wheel, hold Shift, then press and turn the wheel to select the second parameter\nbank.\nAccessing the Filter & Setup Parameter Bank for Drum Sampler.\nAccessing the Setup Parameter Bank for the Melodic Sampler.\nYou can turn the encoders to adjust the parameter values. Once you finish, press the Back button to\nclose the Parameter Banks View and return to the Device View.\n98\n15.9. 1  Sample Parameters in Drum Sampler\nThe following parameters are available in the Main Bank, starting with the leftmost encoder:\nTranspose/Detune  — transposes the sample’s pitch up or down by semitones. Hold Shift while\nturning the encoder to detune the sample in cents.\nSample Start  — adjusts the starting point for the sample’s playback. Hold Shift while turning the\nencoder to zoom in on the waveform for precise adjustments.\nAttack  — sets the time needed for the sample to reach the peak level. Hold Shift while turning\nthe encoder to adjust in fine increments.\nHold  — sets how long the sample plays at the peak level once the Attack time is reached. Hold\nShift while turning the encoder to adjust in fine increments.\nDecay/Length  - Decay  sets how long it takes for the sample to fade to silence from the peak\nlevel after the Hold  time. Hold Shift and then tap the encoder to access the Length  parameter,\nwhich can be used to adjust the sample’s length.\nPlayback Effect  — selects which playback effect is used to manipulate the sample: Stretch , \nLoop , Pitch Env , Punch , 8-Bit , FM, Ring Mod , Sub Osc , or Noise . Each playback effect has two\nunique parameters, which are assigned to encoders 7 and 8.\nThe following parameters are available in the Filter & Setup bank, starting from the leftmost encoder:\nFilter Frequency  — sets the cutoff point for the selected filter type. Hold Shift while turning the\nencoder to adjust in fine increments.\nFilter Resonance  — sets the emphasis of frequencies near the cutoff point. Hold Shift while\nturning the encoder to adjust in fine increments.\nFilter Type  — switches between four filter types: Low-Pass 1 2 , Low-Pass 24 , High-Pass 24 , and \nPeak . The selected filter type determines how frequencies are processed based on the set cutoff\npoint: the low-pass filters remove frequencies above the cutoff, the high-pass filter removes\nfrequencies below the cutoff, and the peak filter emphasizes frequencies near the cutoff.\nEnvelope Mode  — switches between two envelope types: Trigger  and Gate . When set to\nTrigger, the sample plays for the duration set by the Hold parameter, regardless of when the\npad is released. When set to Gate, the sample plays only while the pad is held down.\nChoke  — turns the choke group for a pad on or off. Pads that are added to the choke group\nwill silence any currently playing samples that also belong to the group when triggered. This is\nuseful for cutting off samples that should not be layered, such as open and closed hi-hats. Note\nthat Drum Racks on Move only have one choke group.\nVelocity > …  — selects a target parameter to be modulated by note velocity: Filter , Attack , \nHold , Decay , FX 1, and FX 2. The FX1 and FX2 targets correspond to the parameters mapped\nto encoders 7 and 8 in the Main Bank, and vary depending on the selected playback effect.\nVelocity > (target)  or Velocity > Vol  — The Velocity > (target)  parameter sets the amount of\nmodulation that is applied to the selected target parameter. Hold Shift and tap the encoder to\naccess the Velocity > Vol  parameter, which can be used to set how much note velocity\nmodulates the sample’s volume.\nPan — determines the position of the pad’s sound in the stereo field.1. \n2. \n3. \n4. \n5. \n6. \n1. \n2. \n3. \n4. \n5. \n6. \n7. \n8. \n99\n15.9.2  Sample Parameters in the Melodic Sampler\nThe following parameters can be adjusted in the Main Bank, starting from the leftmost encoder:\nTranspose/Detune  — transposes the sample’s pitch up or down by semitones. Hold Shift while\nturning the encoder to detune the sample in cents.\nSample Start  — adjusts the starting point for the sample’s playback. Hold Shift while turning the\nencoder to zoom in on the waveform for precise adjustments.\nAttack  — sets the time needed for the sample to reach the peak level. Hold Shift while turning\nthe encoder to adjust in fine increments.\nDecay  — sets how long it takes for the sample to fade to silence from the peak level. Hold Shift\nwhile turning the encoder to adjust in fine increments.\nRelease/Playback Length  — Release  sets how quickly the sample becomes silent after the pad\nis released. Hold Shift and tap the encoder to access the Playback Length  parameter, which\ncan be used to adjust the sample’s length.\nFilter Frequency  — sets the cutoff point for the selected filter type. Hold Shift while turning the\nencoder to adjust in fine increments.\nFilter Resonance  — sets the emphasis of frequencies near the cutoff point. Hold Shift while\nturning the encoder to adjust in fine increments.\nFilter LFO/LFO Rate  — Filter LFO  sets how much the LFO modulates the filter cutoff. Hold Shift\nand tap the encoder to access the LFO Rate  parameter, which can be used to set the rate of the\nLFO in Hertz.\nThe following parameters are available in the Setup bank, starting with the leftmost encoder:\nFilter Type  — switches between three filter types: Low-Pass , Band-Pass , and High-Pass . The\nselected filter type determines how frequencies are processed based on the set cutoff point: the\nlow-pass filter removes frequencies above the cutoff, the band-pass filter allows frequencies\nnear the cutoff to pass while removing frequencies on either side of that range, and the high-\npass filter removes frequencies below the cutoff.\nEnvelope Mode  — switches between two envelope types: Trigger  and Gate . When set to\nTrigger, the sample plays for the duration set by the Decay parameter, regardless of when the\npad is released. When set to Gate, the sample plays only while the pad is held down.\n16. Mixing\nThe Volume encoder located at the top right corner of the hardware can be used to adjust the volume\nof individual tracks, pads, and Sets, as well as the overall output during playback.1. \n2. \n3. \n4. \n5. \n6. \n7. \n8. \n1. \n2. \n100\nThe Volume Encoder.\nYou can also turn the Volume encoder to adjust levels when playback is not running, but you will not\nhear any changes.\n16. 1 Output Volume\nTo adjust the overall output volume, turn the Volume encoder while in the Set Overview, Note Mode,\nor Session Mode.\nThe Global Volume Meter.\nAs you turn the encoder, the VU meter on the display indicates the current output level.\n101\n16.2  Track Volume\nIn Note or Session Mode, you can adjust the volume for an individual track by holding the\ncorresponding track button and turning the Volume encoder.\nThe Track Volume in dB.\nThe track volume in dB will be shown on the display as you adjust the encoder.\n16.2. 1  Track Volume Activity\nDuring playback, the track button LEDs indicate the current volume levels of the tracks.
